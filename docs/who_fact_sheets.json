{"title": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "More than 30 different bacteria, viruses and parasites are known to be transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex. Some STIs can also be transmitted from mother-to-child during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding, and unsafe blood transfusion. Eight pathogens are linked to the greatest incidence of STIs. Of these, 4 are currently curable: syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. The other 4 are viral infections: hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus (HSV), HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV).  In addition, emerging outbreaks of new infections that can be acquired by sexual contact such as mpox,  Shigella sonnei ,  Neisseria meningitidis , Ebola and Zika, as well as re-emergence of neglected STIs such as lymphogranuloma venereum. These herald increasing challenges in the provision of adequate services for STIs prevention and control. STIs have a profound impact on sexual and reproductive health worldwide. More than 1 million curable STIs are acquired every day. In 2020, WHO estimated 374 million new infections with 1 of 4 STIs: chlamydia (129 million), gonorrhoea (82 million), syphilis (7.1 million) and trichomoniasis (156 million). More than 520 million people were estimated to be living with genital herpes in 2020, and an estimated 300 million women have an HPV infection, the primary cause of cervical cancer and anal cancer among men who have sex with men. In addition, updated   WHO estimates   that 254 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B in 2022.  STIs can have serious consequences beyond the immediate impact of the infection itself. When used correctly and consistently, condoms offer one of the most effective methods of protection against STIs, including HIV. Although highly effective, condoms do not offer protection for STIs that cause extra-genital ulcers (i.e., syphilis or genital herpes). When possible, condoms should be used in all vaginal, oral and anal sex. Safe and highly effective vaccines are available for 2 viral STIs: hepatitis B and HPV. These vaccines have represented major advances in STI prevention. To eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem globally, high coverage targets for HPV vaccination, screening and treatment of precancerous lesions, and management of cancer must be reached by 2030 and maintained at this high level for decades. The development of vaccines against STIs are a major priority to control STIs worldwide. Currently there is mounting evidence suggesting that the vaccine to prevent meningitis (MenB) provides some cross-protection against gonorrhoea. WHO is closely monitoring the results of ongoing studies to gather evidence. Vaccine candidates against herpes simplex virus, chlamydia and gonorrhoea are in early clinical development, while those against syphilis and trichomoniasis are still in the pre-clinical phase. WHO is currently working on recommendations for the use of doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (also known as Doxy-PEP) for selected bacterial STIs for some populations at higher risk of infection. Other biomedical interventions to prevent some STIs include adult voluntary medical male circumcision, microbicides, and partner treatment.  Diagnosis of STIs STIs are often asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they can be non-specific.  Accurate diagnostic tests for STIs (using molecular technology) are widely used in high-income countries. These are especially useful for the diagnosis of asymptomatic infections. However, they are largely unavailable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Even in countries where testing is available, it is often expensive and not widely accessible. In addition, the time it takes for results to be received is often long. As a result, follow-up can be impeded and care or treatment can be incomplete. On the other hand, inexpensive, rapid tests are available for syphilis, hepatitis B and HIV. The rapid syphilis test and rapid dual HIV/syphilis tests are used in many resource-limited settings.  Several other rapid tests are under development and have the potential to improve STI diagnosis and treatment, especially in resource-limited settings. Screening of asymptomatic STIs is recommended in selected priority populations and settings. Effective treatment is currently available for several STIs. AMR of STIs – in particular gonorrhoea – has increased rapidly in recent years and has reduced treatment options. The  Gonococcal AMR Surveillance Programme (GASP)  has shown high rates of resistance to many antibiotics including quinolone, azithromycin and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, a last-line treatment  (3) .  AMR for other STIs, like  Mycoplasma genitalium , also exist but are not systematically monitored. LMICs rely on identifying consistent, easily recognizable signs and symptoms to guide treatment, without the use of laboratory tests. This approach – syndromic management – often relies on clinical algorithms and allows health workers to diagnose\r\n    a specific infection based on observed syndromes (e.g., vaginal/urethral discharge, anogenital ulcers, etc). Syndromic management is simple, assures rapid, same-day treatment, and avoids expensive or unavailable diagnostic tests for patients with symptoms. However, this approach results in overtreatment and missed treatment as\r\n    the majority of STIs are asymptomatic. Thus, WHO recommends countries to  enhance syndromic management  by gradually incorporating laboratory testing to support diagnosis. In settings where quality assured molecular assays are available, it is recommended to treat STIs such as  gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis,  Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Candida albicans , bacterial vaginosis and human papillomavirus (anogenital warts) , based on laboratory tests and with the most updated treatment evidence-based regimens. Moreover,  STI screening strategies  are essential for those at higher risk of infection, such sex workers, men who have sex with men, adolescents in some high-burden settings and pregnant women. To interrupt transmission and prevent re-infection,  treating sexual partners  is an important component of STI case management.

{"title": "Sepsis", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that happens when the body’s immune system has an extreme response to an infection, causing organ dysfunction  (4) . The body’s reaction causes damage to its own tissues and organs and it can lead to shock, multiple organ failure and sometimes death, especially if not recognized early and treated promptly. Sepsis can affect anyone, but people who are older, very young, pregnant or have other health problems are at higher risk. Common signs of sepsis include fever, fast heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion and body pain. It can lead to septic shock, multiple organ failure and death. Sepsis is usually caused by bacterial infections but may be the result of other infections such as viruses, parasites or fungi. Its treatment requires medical care, including the use of antimicrobials, intravenous fluids and other measures.  Sepsis acquired in health care settings is one of the most frequent adverse events during care delivery and affect hundreds of millions of patients worldwide every year. Healthcare associated infections are caused by pathogens that are often resistant to drugs and can rapidly lead to deteriorating clinical conditions. Antimicrobial resistance is a major factor determining clinical unresponsiveness to treatment and rapid evolution to sepsis and septic shock. Sepsis patients with resistant pathogens have been found to have a higher risk of hospital mortality. There were an estimated 4.95 million deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance in 2019, including 1.27 million deaths directly attributable to it  (5) .  Implementing preventive measures against infections, such as good hygiene practices, ensuring access to vaccination programmes, improved sanitation and water quality and availability, and other infection prevention and control best practices both in the community and health care settings, are key steps in reducing the occurrence of sepsis. Early diagnosis and timely and appropriate clinical management of sepsis, such as optimal antimicrobial use and fluid resuscitation, are crucial to increase the likelihood of survival. Even though the onset of sepsis can be acute and poses a short-term mortality burden, it can also be the cause of significant long-term morbidity requiring treatment and support. Thus, sepsis requires a multidisciplinary approach. Anyone affected by an infection, severe injury, or serious non-communicable disease can progress to sepsis but vulnerable populations are at higher risk ( 6,7 ) including: Sepsis is a medical emergency. It can cause different signs and symptoms at different times. People who think they may have sepsis should seek medical care right away. Common signs and symptoms include: Symptoms in children include: In children under 5 years old, it can cause difficulty feeding, frequent vomiting or lack of urination. Sepsis can be prevented by treating infections early and through good hygiene at home and in healthcare settings. The best way to reduce the risk of sepsis is to avoid infections. Steps include: Hospitals and clinics should follow effective rules for infection prevention and control. Antibiotics should be used appropriately to treat infections. Sepsis is always a serious condition but people living with HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and other infectious diseases are at higher risk. Treatment for sepsis is most effective when started early. Health workers watch for concerning signs and use tests to diagnose sepsis. They will then work to find the source of the infection. Early use of antimicrobials to treat bacteria, parasites, fungus or viruses is essential to improve outcomes from sepsis. Low blood pressure is treated by intravenous fluids and sometimes medicines called vasopressors, which can increase blood pressure.  Antibiotic resistance can make treatment more difficult. Sepsis is a significant cause of maternal, neonatal and child mortality. Consequently, combating sepsis will contribute to achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets 3.8 on quality of care, and 3.1 and 3.2 by improving mortality rates in these vulnerable populations. Sepsis can also ultimately lead to death in patients affected by HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and other infectious diseases that are included in target 3.3. The prevention and/or appropriate diagnosis and management of sepsis is also linked to adequate vaccine coverage, quality universal health coverage, capacity to comply with the International Health Regulations, preparedness, and water and sanitation services. The challenge, however, remains how to achieve universal prevention, diagnosis and management of sepsis. To combat this important global health threat, WHO responded with a WHO Secretariat Report and, in May 2017, the Seventieth World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA70.7 on improving the prevention, diagnosis and clinical management of sepsis. The key pillars of Resolution WHA70.7 are to: In collaboration and coordination with WHO regional offices, Member States and other stakeholders, several WHO headquarters programmes are currently working on the public health impact of sepsis and providing guidance and country support on sepsis prevention, early and appropriate diagnosis, and timely and appropriate clinical management.   References", "Overview": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that happens when the body’s immune system has an extreme response to an infection, causing organ dysfunction  (4) .

Common signs and symptoms include: Symptoms in children include: In children under 5 years old, it can cause difficulty feeding, frequent vomiting or lack of urination. Sepsis can be prevented by treating infections early and through good hygiene at home and in healthcare settings. The best way to reduce the risk of sepsis is to avoid infections. Steps include: Hospitals and clinics should follow effective rules for infection prevention and control. Antibiotics should be used appropriately to treat infections. Sepsis is always a serious condition but people living with HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and other infectious diseases are at higher risk. Treatment for sepsis is most effective when started early. Health workers watch for concerning signs and use tests to diagnose sepsis. They will then work to find the source of the infection. Early use of antimicrobials to treat bacteria, parasites, fungus or viruses is essential to improve outcomes from sepsis. Low blood pressure is treated by intravenous fluids and sometimes medicines called vasopressors, which can increase blood pressure.  Antibiotic resistance can make treatment more difficult. Sepsis is a significant cause of maternal, neonatal and child mortality. Consequently, combating sepsis will contribute to achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets 3.8 on quality of care, and 3.1 and 3.2 by improving mortality rates in these vulnerable populations. Sepsis can also ultimately lead to death in patients affected by HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and other infectious diseases that are included in target 3.3. The prevention and/or appropriate diagnosis and management of sepsis is also linked to adequate vaccine coverage, quality universal health coverage, capacity to comply with the International Health Regulations, preparedness, and water and sanitation services. The challenge, however, remains how to achieve universal prevention, diagnosis and management of sepsis. To combat this important global health threat, WHO responded with a WHO Secretariat Report and, in May 2017, the Seventieth World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA70.7 on improving the prevention, diagnosis and clinical management of sepsis.

{"title": "Schizophrenia", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Schizophrenia is characterised by significant impairments in the way reality is perceived and changes in behaviour related to: People with schizophrenia often also experience persistent difficulties with their cognitive or thinking skills, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving. At least one third of people with schizophrenia experiences complete remission of symptoms (1). Some people with schizophrenia experience worsening and remission of symptoms periodically throughout their lives, others a gradual worsening of symptoms over\r\n    time. Schizophrenia affects approximately 23 million people or 1 in 345 people (0.29%) worldwide. The rate is 1 in 233 people (0.43%) among adults (2). It is not as common as many other mental disorders. Onset is most often during late adolescence and the\r\n    twenties, and onset tends to happen earlier among men than among women.  Schizophrenia is frequently associated with significant distress and impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, and other important areas of life.  People with schizophrenia die nine years earlier  than the general population (3). This is often due to physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases. People with schizophrenia often experience human rights violations both inside mental health institutions and in community settings. Stigma against people with this condition is intense and widespread, causing social exclusion, and impacting their relationships\r\n    with others, including family and friends. This contributes to discrimination, which in turn can limit access to general health care, education, housing, and employment.   During humanitarian and public health emergencies, extreme stress and fear, breakdown of social supports, isolation and disruption of health-care services and supply of medication can occur. These changes can have an impact on the lives of people with\r\n    schizophrenia, such as exacerbation of existing symptoms. During emergencies, people with schizophrenia are more vulnerable than others to various human rights violations, including neglect, abandonment, homelessness, abuse and exclusion.  Research has not identified one single cause of schizophrenia. It is thought that an interaction between genes and a range of environmental factors may cause schizophrenia.  Psychosocial factors may also affect the onset and course of schizophrenia.\r\n    Heavy use of cannabis is associated with an elevated risk of the disorder.  Currently, the vast majority of people with schizophrenia around the world are not receiving mental health care. Approximately 50% of people in mental hospitals have a schizophrenia diagnosis (4). Only 29% of people with psychosis receive specialist\r\n    mental health care (5). Most resources for mental health services are inefficiently spent on care within mental hospitals. There is clear evidence that mental hospitals are not effective in providing the care that people with mental health conditions need and, regularly, violate the basic human rights of persons with schizophrenia. Efforts to transfer care from mental health\r\n    institutions to the community need to be expanded and accelerated. Such efforts start with the development of a range of quality community-based mental health services. Options for community-based mental health care include integration in primary\r\n    health and general hospital care, community mental health centres, day centres, supported housing, and outreach services for home-based support. The engagement of the person with schizophrenia, family members and the wider community in providing support\r\n    is important. A range of effective care options for people with schizophrenia exist, and these include medication, psychoeducation, family interventions, cognitive-behavioural therapy and psychosocial rehabilitation (e.g. life skills training). Facilitated assisted\r\n    living, supported housing and supported employment are essential care options that should be available for people with schizophrenia.  A recovery-oriented approach – giving people agency in treatment decisions – is essential for people\r\n    with schizophrenia and for their families and/or caregivers as well. WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030  highlights the steps required to provide appropriate services for people with mental disorders including schizophrenia. A key recommendation of the Action Plan is to shift services from institutions\r\n    to the community. The WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health aims to further progress towards objectives of the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 by ensuring 100 million more people have access to quality and affordable care for\r\n    mental health conditions. WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP)  uses evidence-based technical guidance, tools and training packages to expand service in countries, especially in resource-poor settings. It focuses on a prioritized set of conditions, including psychosis,\r\n    directing capacity building towards non-specialized health-care providers in an integrated approach that promotes mental health at all levels of care. Currently mhGAP is being implemented in more than 100 WHO Member States. The  WHO QualityRights Project  involves improving the quality of care and human rights conditions in mental health and social care facilities and to empower organizations to advocate for the health of people with mental health conditions and psychosocial\r\n    disabilities.   The WHO guidance on community mental health services and person-centred and rights-based approaches  provides information and support to all stakeholders who wish to develop or transform their mental health system and services to align with international\r\n    human rights standards including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Efforts to transfer care from mental health\r\n    institutions to the community need to be expanded and accelerated. Such efforts start with the development of a range of quality community-based mental health services. Options for community-based mental health care include integration in primary\r\n    health and general hospital care, community mental health centres, day centres, supported housing, and outreach services for home-based support. The engagement of the person with schizophrenia, family members and the wider community in providing support\r\n    is important. A range of effective care options for people with schizophrenia exist, and these include medication, psychoeducation, family interventions, cognitive-behavioural therapy and psychosocial rehabilitation (e.g. life skills training). Facilitated assisted\r\n    living, supported housing and supported employment are essential care options that should be available for people with schizophrenia.  A recovery-oriented approach – giving people agency in treatment decisions – is essential for people\r\n    with schizophrenia and for their families and/or caregivers as well. WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030  highlights the steps required to provide appropriate services for people with mental disorders including schizophrenia. A key recommendation of the Action Plan is to shift services from institutions\r\n    to the community. The WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health aims to further progress towards objectives of the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 by ensuring 100 million more people have access to quality and affordable care for\r\n    mental health conditions. WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP)  uses evidence-based technical guidance, tools and training packages to expand service in countries, especially in resource-poor settings. It focuses on a prioritized set of conditions, including psychosis,\r\n    directing capacity building towards non-specialized health-care providers in an integrated approach that promotes mental health at all levels of care. Currently mhGAP is being implemented in more than 100 WHO Member States. The  WHO QualityRights Project  involves improving the quality of care and human rights conditions in mental health and social care facilities and to empower organizations to advocate for the health of people with mental health conditions and psychosocial\r\n    disabilities.   The WHO guidance on community mental health services and person-centred and rights-based approaches  provides information and support to all stakeholders who wish to develop or transform their mental health system and services to align with international\r\n    human rights standards including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

{"title": "Scabies", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Scabies is a parasitic infestation caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin and lay eggs, causing intense itching and a rash. Scabies can lead to skin sores and serious complications like septicaemia (a bloodstream infection), heart disease and kidney problems. It is treated using creams or oral medications. Scabies is contagious and spreads through skin-to-skin contact. It occurs worldwide but is most common in low-income tropical areas. Children and older people in resource-poor areas are at higher risk. Scabies is one of the commonest dermatological conditions, accounting for a substantial proportion of skin disease in developing countries. Globally, it is estimated to affect more than 200 million people at any time and more than 400 million people cumulatively every year. Scabies is found in every country but is particularly common in many resource-poor tropical settings, particularly in children and older people. Prevalence among children in these settings may vary from 5% up to 50%. Recurrent infestations are common. The sheer burden of scabies infestation and its complications imposes a major cost on health care systems. Cases are sporadic in high-income countries, yet outbreaks in health institutions and vulnerable communities contribute to significant economic cost in national health services.  Several studies have shown that outbreaks of scabies are a major risk factor for kidney disease in the form of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. A growing body of evidence also implicates impetigo caused by  Streptococcus pyogenes  in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. Symptoms of scabies usually begin 4–6 weeks after infestation. Sometimes there are visible signs before symptoms begin. Symptoms of scabies include: Most individuals are infected with 10–15 mites. People with suppressed immune systems, including people living with HIV, may develop crusted (Norwegian) scabies. This severe infection can have thousands or millions or mites and causes dry, scaley areas on the skin. It often does not cause itch. Crusted scabies spreads very easily and can cause secondary infections. It is life threatening.   Scabies mites burrow into the top layer of skin, where the adult female lays eggs. The eggs hatch in 3–4 days and develop into adult mites in 1–2 weeks. After 4–6 weeks the patient develops an allergic reaction to the presence of mite proteins and faeces in the scabies burrow, causing intense itch and rash. Mite effects on immunity, as well as the direct effects of scratching, can lead to inoculation of the skin with bacteria, leading to the development of impetigo (skin sores), especially in the tropics. Impetigo may become complicated by deeper skin infection such as abscesses or serious invasive disease, including septicaemia. In tropical settings, scabies-associated skin infection is a common risk factor for kidney disease and possibly rheumatic heart disease. Evidence of acute renal damage can be found in up to 10% of children with scabies infestation in resource-poor settings and, in many, this persists for years following infection contributing to permanent kidney damage.  Treating scabies as soon as possible is the best way to prevent outbreaks. The mites that cause scabies usually die after 2–3 days away from human skin. Prevent scabies from spreading with these steps: Scabies is transmitted person-to-person through close skin contact (e.g. living in the same residence) with an infested individual. The risk of transmission increases with the level of infestation, with highest risk due to contact with individuals with crusted scabies. Transmission due to contact with infested personal items (e.g., clothes and bed linens) is unlikely with common scabies but may be important for individuals with crusted scabies. As there is an asymptomatic period of infestation, transmission may occur before the initially infested person develops symptoms.  Diagnosis of scabies is based on clinical recognition of the typical features of infestation. The diagnosis of scabies can be supported by visual imaging techniques such as dermatoscopy or microscopy of skin scrapings from burrows, but this is generally not necessary, especially in highly endemic areas. Patients typically present with severe itch, linear burrows and papules around the finger webs, wrists, upper and lower limbs, and belt area. Infants and small children may have a more widespread rash, including involvement of the palms, soles of the feet, ankles, and sometimes the scalp. Inflammatory scabies nodules may be seen, particularly on the penis and scrotum of adult males and around the breasts of females. Because of the delay between initial infection and development of symptoms, scabies lesions may be seen in close contacts that have not yet developed itch. Scabies can be treated with topical creams or oral medication in more severe cases. Itchiness often gets worse for 1–2 weeks after treatment starts. Topical treatments that are applied to the whole body include: Ivermectin taken orally is also highly effective, but it should not be taken by pregnant women or children who weigh less than 15 kg. Treatments do not kill the parasite’s eggs, and treatment should be repeated to kill newly hatched mites. People do not experience symptoms in the early stages of infestation. To reduce spread, all people in the household should be treated, even if they do not have symptoms. Other treatments may be needed to treat the complications of scabies. Antiseptics or antibiotics are used to treat bacterial skin infections or impetigo. Patients with crusted scabies are highly infectious and a source of reinfection to the rest of the community. Patients with crusted scabies need intense treatment with both topical and oral medications. Population control of scabies and its complications has been identified by a number of countries as a public health priority, and several studies have shown that mass drug administration (MDA) strategies have the potential to substantially reduce prevalence of scabies, with concomitant reductions in impetigo. In 2019 WHO convened an  informal consultation  of global experts to review available data and develop recommendations on strategies for global and country level control. The experts agreed that there is convincing evidence that MDA can be highly effective in places where the prevalence is 10% or greater, but the evidence for its effectiveness in places with lower prevalence is less clear. The current recommendation is that two doses of ivermectin (dose 200µg/kg) should be administered and a topical agent such as permethrin 5% cream should be given when ivermectin is contraindicated or not available. There is ongoing research to determine if one dose of treatment is sufficient for MDA, however currently the evidence is inconclusive. Further research is required to define the strategies to be used when the prevalence is low, either at baseline or when achieved by MDA. Outbreaks of scabies can occur in either closed, institutional settings (such as hospitals, boarding schools or long-term care facilities) or open community settings. Refugee or internally displaced person camps are at particularly high risk due to overcrowding which increases skin to skin contact. Outbreaks can be extended and difficult to control. The general principles include surveillance in high-risk settings, early confirmation of an outbreak, and involvement of public health experts. The WHO informal consultation on a Framework for Scabies Control Meeting Report outlines the key operational research that is still required to develop guidelines for control and surveillance strategy for all contexts. Large scale scabies MDAs are ongoing in PNG, Vanuatu, Fiji and Solomon Islands. In 2017, scabies and other ectoparasites were included as Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) by the WHO, in response to requests from Member States and the recommendations of the WHO Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for NTDs. WHO 2030 global targets for scabies include: WHO works with Member States and partners to develop control strategies and scabies outbreak response plans. WHO recommends that control strategies for scabies should be part of an  integrated skin NTDs approach  adapted to the diseases present in a particular country in order to facilitate rapid, cost-effective uptake of the strategy.  Ivermectin is now included on the WHO essential medicines list for scabies and a number of suppliers have been WHO prequalified.   References:", "Scope of the problem": "Scabies is one of the commonest dermatological conditions, accounting for a substantial proportion of skin disease in developing countries.

The risk of transmission increases with the level of infestation, with highest risk due to contact with individuals with crusted scabies. Transmission due to contact with infested personal items (e.g., clothes and bed linens) is unlikely with common scabies but may be important for individuals with crusted scabies. As there is an asymptomatic period of infestation, transmission may occur before the initially infested person develops symptoms.  Diagnosis of scabies is based on clinical recognition of the typical features of infestation. The diagnosis of scabies can be supported by visual imaging techniques such as dermatoscopy or microscopy of skin scrapings from burrows, but this is generally not necessary, especially in highly endemic areas. Patients typically present with severe itch, linear burrows and papules around the finger webs, wrists, upper and lower limbs, and belt area. Infants and small children may have a more widespread rash, including involvement of the palms, soles of the feet, ankles, and sometimes the scalp. Inflammatory scabies nodules may be seen, particularly on the penis and scrotum of adult males and around the breasts of females. Because of the delay between initial infection and development of symptoms, scabies lesions may be seen in close contacts that have not yet developed itch. Scabies can be treated with topical creams or oral medication in more severe cases. Itchiness often gets worse for 1–2 weeks after treatment starts. Topical treatments that are applied to the whole body include: Ivermectin taken orally is also highly effective, but it should not be taken by pregnant women or children who weigh less than 15 kg. Treatments do not kill the parasite’s eggs, and treatment should be repeated to kill newly hatched mites. People do not experience symptoms in the early stages of infestation. To reduce spread, all people in the household should be treated, even if they do not have symptoms. Other treatments may be needed to treat the complications of scabies. Antiseptics or antibiotics are used to treat bacterial skin infections or impetigo. Patients with crusted scabies are highly infectious and a source of reinfection to the rest of the community. Patients with crusted scabies need intense treatment with both topical and oral medications. Population control of scabies and its complications has been identified by a number of countries as a public health priority, and several studies have shown that mass drug administration (MDA) strategies have the potential to substantially reduce prevalence of scabies, with concomitant reductions in impetigo. In 2019 WHO convened an  informal consultation  of global experts to review available data and develop recommendations on strategies for global and country level control. The experts agreed that there is convincing evidence that MDA can be highly effective in places where the prevalence is 10% or greater, but the evidence for its effectiveness in places with lower prevalence is less clear. The current recommendation is that two doses of ivermectin (dose 200µg/kg) should be administered and a topical agent such as permethrin 5% cream should be given when ivermectin is contraindicated or not available. There is ongoing research to determine if one dose of treatment is sufficient for MDA, however currently the evidence is inconclusive. Further research is required to define the strategies to be used when the prevalence is low, either at baseline or when achieved by MDA.

{"title": "Vector-borne diseases", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Vectors are living organisms that can transmit infectious pathogens between humans, or from animals to humans. Many of these vectors are bloodsucking insects which ingest disease-producing microorganisms during a blood meal from an infected host (human or animal) and later transmit it into a new host, after the pathogen has replicated. Often, once a vector becomes infectious, they are capable of transmitting the pathogen for the rest of their life during each subsequent bite/blood meal. Vector-borne diseases are human illnesses caused by parasites, viruses and bacteria that are transmitted by vectors. Every year there are more than 700 000 deaths from diseases such as malaria, dengue, schistosomiasis, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and onchocerciasis. The burden of these diseases is highest in tropical and subtropical areas, and they disproportionately affect the poorest populations. Since 2014, major outbreaks of dengue, malaria, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika have afflicted populations, claimed lives, and overwhelmed health systems in many countries. Other diseases such as chikungunya, leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis cause chronic suffering, life-long morbidity, disability and occasional stigmatization. Distribution of vector-borne diseases is determined by a complex set of demographic, environmental and social factors. Global travel and trade, unplanned urbanization, climate change and silent spread and adaptation of the vectors have all contributed to the spread of vector-borne diseases.  Climate change substantially affects pathogens (parasites, viruses and bacteria), vectors, and reservoir hosts, with implications for the transmission of many vector-borne diseases. Several vectors have expanded their latitude and altitude ranges, and the length of the season during which they are active is increasing. These trends are expected to continue as the climate continues to get warmer.     WHO response The  Global Vector Control Response (GVCR) 2017–2030  was approved by the World Health Assembly in 2017. It provides strategic guidance to countries and development partners for urgently strengthening vector control as a fundamental approach to preventing disease and responding to outbreaks. To achieve this, a re-alignment of vector control programmes is required, supported by increased technical capacity, improved infrastructure, strengthened monitoring and surveillance systems, and greater community mobilization. Ultimately, this will support the implementation of a comprehensive approach to vector control that will enable the achievement of disease-specific national and global goals and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage. WHO Secretariat provides strategic, normative, and technical guidance to countries and development partners to strengthen vector control as a fundamental approach based on GVCR to prevent disease and respond to outbreaks. Specifically, WHO responds to vector-borne diseases by: A crucial element in reducing the burden of vector-borne diseases is behavioural change. WHO works with partners to provide education and improve public awareness, so that people know how to protect themselves and their communities from mosquitoes, ticks, bugs, flies and other vectors. Access to water and sanitation is a very important factor in disease control and elimination. WHO works together with many different government sectors to improve water storage, sanitation, thereby helping to control these diseases at the community level.", "Overview": "Vectors are living organisms that can transmit infectious pathogens between humans, or from animals to humans.

Every year there are more than 700 000 deaths from diseases such as malaria, dengue, schistosomiasis, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and onchocerciasis. The burden of these diseases is highest in tropical and subtropical areas, and they disproportionately affect the poorest populations. Since 2014, major outbreaks of dengue, malaria, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika have afflicted populations, claimed lives, and overwhelmed health systems in many countries. Other diseases such as chikungunya, leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis cause chronic suffering, life-long morbidity, disability and occasional stigmatization. Distribution of vector-borne diseases is determined by a complex set of demographic, environmental and social factors. Global travel and trade, unplanned urbanization, climate change and silent spread and adaptation of the vectors have all contributed to the spread of vector-borne diseases.  Climate change substantially affects pathogens (parasites, viruses and bacteria), vectors, and reservoir hosts, with implications for the transmission of many vector-borne diseases. Several vectors have expanded their latitude and altitude ranges, and the length of the season during which they are active is increasing. These trends are expected to continue as the climate continues to get warmer.     WHO response The  Global Vector Control Response (GVCR) 2017–2030  was approved by the World Health Assembly in 2017. It provides strategic guidance to countries and development partners for urgently strengthening vector control as a fundamental approach to preventing disease and responding to outbreaks. To achieve this, a re-alignment of vector control programmes is required, supported by increased technical capacity, improved infrastructure, strengthened monitoring and surveillance systems, and greater community mobilization. Ultimately, this will support the implementation of a comprehensive approach to vector control that will enable the achievement of disease-specific national and global goals and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage. WHO Secretariat provides strategic, normative, and technical guidance to countries and development partners to strengthen vector control as a fundamental approach based on GVCR to prevent disease and respond to outbreaks. Specifically, WHO responds to vector-borne diseases by: A crucial element in reducing the burden of vector-borne diseases is behavioural change. WHO works with partners to provide education and improve public awareness, so that people know how to protect themselves and their communities from mosquitoes, ticks, bugs, flies and other vectors.

{"title": "Typhoid", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium  Salmonella  Typhi. It is usually spread through contaminated food or water. Once  Salmonella  Typhi bacteria are ingested, they multiply and spread into the bloodstream. Urbanization and climate change have the potential to increase the global burden of typhoid. In addition, increasing resistance to antibiotic treatment is making it easier for typhoid to spread in communities that lack access to safe drinking water or adequate sanitation. Salmonella  Typhi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. Symptoms include prolonged high fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhoea. Some patients may have a rash. Severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death. Typhoid fever can be confirmed through blood testing. Improved living conditions and the introduction of antibiotics resulted in a drastic reduction of typhoid fever morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. However, the disease continues to be a public health problem in many developing areas of the WHO African, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. As of 2019 estimates, there are 9 million cases of typhoid fever annually, resulting in about 110 000 deaths per year. Typhoid risk is higher in populations that lack access to safe water and adequate sanitation, and children are at highest risk. Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics.  Antimicrobial resistance is common with likelihood of more complicated and expensive treatment options required in the most affected regions. Even when the symptoms go away, people may still be carrying typhoid bacteria, meaning they can spread it to others, through shedding of bacteria in their faeces. It is important for people being treated for typhoid fever to do the following: Typhoid fever is common in places with poor sanitation and a lack of safe drinking water. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, hygiene among food handlers and typhoid vaccination are all effective in preventing typhoid fever. Typhoid conjugate vaccine, consisting of the purified Vi antigen linked to a carrier protein, is given as a single injectable dose in children from 6 months of age and in adults up to 45 years or 65 years (depending on the vaccine).  Two additional vaccines have been used for many years in older children and adults at risk of typhoid, including travellers. These vaccines do not provide long-lasting immunity (requiring repeat or booster doses) and are not approved for children younger than 2 years old: Two typhoid conjugate vaccines have been prequalified by WHO since December 2017 and are being introduced into childhood immunization programmes in typhoid endemic countries. All travellers to endemic areas are at potential risk of typhoid fever, although the risk is generally low in tourist and business centres where standards of accommodation, sanitation and food hygiene are high. Typhoid fever vaccination should be offered to travellers to destinations where the risk of typhoid fever is high. The following recommendations will help ensure safety while travelling: In October 2017, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), which advises WHO on vaccine use, issued a recommendation for the typhoid conjugate vaccine to be added to routine childhood immunization programmes in typhoid endemic countries. SAGE also called for the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccine to be prioritized for countries with the highest burden of typhoid disease or high levels of antibiotic resistance to  Salmonella  Typhi. Starting in 2019, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance has provided funding to support typhoid conjugate vaccine use in eligible countries. As at March 2023, WHO has prequalified two conjugate vaccines for the prevention of typhoid.

{"title": "Tuberculosis", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria that most often affects the lungs. It spreads through the air when people with TB cough, sneeze or spit. Tuberculosis is preventable and curable. About a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacteria. In general, people with TB infection don’t feel sick and are not contagious. About 5–10% of people infected with TB will eventually get symptoms and develop TB disease. Babies and children are at higher risk of developing the disease if they are infected. TB disease is usually treated with antibiotics and can be fatal without treatment. In certain countries, the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is given to babies or small children to prevent TB. The vaccine prevents deaths from TB and protects children from serious forms of TB. Certain conditions can increase a person’s risk for TB disease: In general, people with TB infection don’t feel sick and are not contagious. Only a small proportion of people who get infected with TB will get TB disease and develop symptoms. Babies and children are at higher risk of developing the disease if they are infected. TB disease occurs when bacteria multiply in the body and affect different organs. TB symptoms may be mild for many months, so it is easy to spread TB to others without knowing it. Symptoms depend on which part of the body is affected. While TB usually affects the lungs, it can also affect the kidneys, brain, and spine. Some people with TB disease do not have any symptoms but can still spread TB. Common symptoms of TB are: The symptoms people get depend on which part of the body is affected by TB. While TB usually affects the lungs, it can also involve the kidneys, brain, spine and skin. Follow these steps to help prevent tuberculosis infection and spread: WHO recommends the use of rapid diagnostic tests as the initial diagnostic tests in all persons with signs and symptoms of TB. Rapid diagnostic tests recommended by WHO include  biomarker-based point-of-care tests and molecular assays. All these tests are accurate and can provide initial results to guide treatment decisions within 48 hours of sample collection. Use of these tests will lead to major improvements in the early detection of TB and drug-resistant TB. Diagnosing drug-resistant forms of TB, including multidrug-resistant TB, as well as HIV-associated TB and pediatric TB can be complex. WHO recommends specific sample types, tests and strategies to detect these forms of TB to increase the chances of detecting disease early and accurately. A tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) or newer antigen-based skin test (TBST) can be used to identify people with TB infection. The results from these TB infection tests are used to identify which individuals with a high risk of TB will benefit most from TB preventive treatment. Tuberculosis disease is treated with special antibiotics. Treatment is recommended for both TB infection and disease. The most common antibiotics used are: To be effective, medications need to be taken daily for 4–6 months. It is dangerous to stop the medications early or without medical advice as it can prompt TB bacteria in the body to become resistant to the antibiotics. TB that doesn’t respond to standard drugs is called drug-resistant TB and requires treatment with different medicines. Drug resistance emerges when TB medicines are used inappropriately, through incorrect prescription by health care providers, poor quality drugs, or patients stopping treatment prematurely. MDR-TB is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using other drugs, which tend to be more expensive and with more side effects. People exposed to MDR-TB may receive TB preventive treatment with levofloxacin. In some cases, extensively drug-resistant TB or XDR-TB can develop. TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective drugs in MDR-TB treatment regimens can leave patients with very limited treatment options. MDR-TB remains a public health crisis. Only about 2 in 5 people with multidrug-resistant TB accessed treatment in 2024. In accordance with WHO guidelines, detection of MDR-TB requires bacteriological confirmation of TB and testing for drug resistance using rapid molecular tests or culture methods. In 2022, new WHO guidelines prioritized a short 6-month all-oral regimen known as BPaLM/BPaL as a treatment of choice for eligible patients. Globally in 2024, approximately 34 000 people with MDR/RR-TB were reported to have started treatment on the 6-month shorter regimens (known as BPaLM and BDLLfxC), a substantial increase from 5653 in 2023 and 1744 in 2022. The shorter duration, lower pill burden and high efficacy of this novel regimen can help ease the burden on health systems and save precious resources to further expand the diagnostic and treatment coverage for all individuals in need. WHO recommends expanded access to all-oral regimens. People living with HIV are 12 times more likely to fall ill with TB disease than people without HIV. TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV. HIV and TB form a lethal combination, each accelerating the other's progress. In 2024, about 150 000 people died of HIV-associated TB. The percentage of people who fell ill with TB and had a documented HIV test result was 82% in 2024. This was a slight increase from 81% in 2023. The WHO African Region has the highest burden of HIV-associated TB. Globally in 2024, only 61% of the estimated number of people  living with HIV who developed TB received antiretroviral therapy (ART). WHO first recommended collaborative TB/HIV activities to reduce morbidity and mortality from HIV-associated TB in 2004. These activities include  bidirectional screening, prevention and treatment of infection and disease. Scale-up of TB treatment and ART since 2005 is estimated to have averted 9.8 million deaths. TB mostly affects adults in their most productive years. However, all age groups are at risk. Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2024, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in the WHO South-East Asia Region (34%), followed by the Western Pacific Region (27%) and the African Region (25%). Around 87% of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries, with two-thirds of the global total in India (25%), Indonesia (10%), the Philippines (6.8%), China (6.5%), Pakistan (6.3%), Nigeria (4.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (3.9%) and Bangladesh (3.6%). The top five countries accounted for 55% of the global total. Globally, about 50% of people treated for TB and their households face total costs (direct medical expenditures, non-medical expenditures and indirect costs such as income losses) that are catastrophic (>20% of total household income). This is far from the target of the WHO End TB Strategy of zero. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, undernutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco have a higher risk of falling ill. Globally in 2024, there were an estimated 0.97 million new TB cases that were attributable to undernutrition, 0.93 million to diabetes, 0.74 million to alcohol use disorders, 0.70 million to smoking and 0.57 million to HIV infection. US$ 22 billion are needed annually for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care to achieve global targets by 2027 agreed on at the 2023 UN high level-TB meeting. As in the past decade, most of the spending on TB services in 2024 (82%) was from domestic sources. In absolute terms, Brazil, China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa accounted for US$ 3.1 billion (64%) of the total of US$ 4.8 billion provided from domestic sources in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), international donor funding amounted to US$ 1.1 billion, having ranged from US$ 1.1 billion to US$ 1.2 billion in almost every year since 2015. Financing for TB research and innovation, at US$ 1.2 billion in 2023, also continues to fall far short of the global target of US$ 5 billion per year. Progress to date  has been constrained by the overall level of investment. WHO is working closely with countries, partners and civil society to scaler up the TB response. Six core functions are being pursued by WHO to contribute to achieving the targets of the 2023 UN High-level Meeting political declaration, Sustainable Development Goals, the WHO End TB Strategy and WHO strategic priorities.", "Overview": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria that most often affects the lungs.

Only about 2 in 5 people with multidrug-resistant TB accessed treatment in 2024. In accordance with WHO guidelines, detection of MDR-TB requires bacteriological confirmation of TB and testing for drug resistance using rapid molecular tests or culture methods. In 2022, new WHO guidelines prioritized a short 6-month all-oral regimen known as BPaLM/BPaL as a treatment of choice for eligible patients. Globally in 2024, approximately 34 000 people with MDR/RR-TB were reported to have started treatment on the 6-month shorter regimens (known as BPaLM and BDLLfxC), a substantial increase from 5653 in 2023 and 1744 in 2022. The shorter duration, lower pill burden and high efficacy of this novel regimen can help ease the burden on health systems and save precious resources to further expand the diagnostic and treatment coverage for all individuals in need. WHO recommends expanded access to all-oral regimens. People living with HIV are 12 times more likely to fall ill with TB disease than people without HIV. TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV. HIV and TB form a lethal combination, each accelerating the other's progress. In 2024, about 150 000 people died of HIV-associated TB. The percentage of people who fell ill with TB and had a documented HIV test result was 82% in 2024. This was a slight increase from 81% in 2023. The WHO African Region has the highest burden of HIV-associated TB. Globally in 2024, only 61% of the estimated number of people  living with HIV who developed TB received antiretroviral therapy (ART). WHO first recommended collaborative TB/HIV activities to reduce morbidity and mortality from HIV-associated TB in 2004. These activities include  bidirectional screening, prevention and treatment of infection and disease. Scale-up of TB treatment and ART since 2005 is estimated to have averted 9.8 million deaths. TB mostly affects adults in their most productive years. However, all age groups are at risk. Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2024, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in the WHO South-East Asia Region (34%), followed by the Western Pacific Region (27%) and the African Region (25%). Around 87% of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries, with two-thirds of the global total in India (25%), Indonesia (10%), the Philippines (6.8%), China (6.5%), Pakistan (6.3%), Nigeria (4.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (3.9%) and Bangladesh (3.6%). The top five countries accounted for 55% of the global total. Globally, about 50% of people treated for TB and their households face total costs (direct medical expenditures, non-medical expenditures and indirect costs such as income losses) that are catastrophic (>20% of total household income). This is far from the target of the WHO End TB Strategy of zero. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, undernutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco have a higher risk of falling ill. Globally in 2024, there were an estimated 0.97 million new TB cases that were attributable to undernutrition, 0.93 million to diabetes, 0.74 million to alcohol use disorders, 0.70 million to smoking and 0.57 million to HIV infection. US$ 22 billion are needed annually for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care to achieve global targets by 2027 agreed on at the 2023 UN high level-TB meeting. As in the past decade, most of the spending on TB services in 2024 (82%) was from domestic sources. In absolute terms, Brazil, China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa accounted for US$ 3.1 billion (64%) of the total of US$ 4.8 billion provided from domestic sources in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), international donor funding amounted to US$ 1.1 billion, having ranged from US$ 1.1 billion to US$ 1.2 billion in almost every year since 2015. Financing for TB research and innovation, at US$ 1.2 billion in 2023, also continues to fall far short of the global target of US$ 5 billion per year. Progress to date  has been constrained by the overall level of investment. WHO is working closely with countries, partners and civil society to scaler up the TB response. Six core functions are being pursued by WHO to contribute to achieving the targets of the 2023 UN High-level Meeting political declaration, Sustainable Development Goals, the WHO End TB Strategy and WHO strategic priorities.", "Symptoms": "In general, people with TB infection don’t feel sick and are not contagious. Only a small proportion of people who get infected with TB will get TB disease and develop symptoms. Babies and children are at higher risk of developing the disease if they are infected. TB disease occurs when bacteria multiply in the body and affect different organs. TB symptoms may be mild for many months, so it is easy to spread TB to others without knowing it. Symptoms depend on which part of the body is affected. While TB usually affects the lungs, it can also affect the kidneys, brain, and spine. Some people with TB disease do not have any symptoms but can still spread TB. Common symptoms of TB are: The symptoms people get depend on which part of the body is affected by TB. While TB usually affects the lungs, it can also involve the kidneys, brain, spine and skin. Follow these steps to help prevent tuberculosis infection and spread: WHO recommends the use of rapid diagnostic tests as the initial diagnostic tests in all persons with signs and symptoms of TB. Rapid diagnostic tests recommended by WHO include  biomarker-based point-of-care tests and molecular assays. All these tests are accurate and can provide initial results to guide treatment decisions within 48 hours of sample collection. Use of these tests will lead to major improvements in the early detection of TB and drug-resistant TB. Diagnosing drug-resistant forms of TB, including multidrug-resistant TB, as well as HIV-associated TB and pediatric TB can be complex. WHO recommends specific sample types, tests and strategies to detect these forms of TB to increase the chances of detecting disease early and accurately. A tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) or newer antigen-based skin test (TBST) can be used to identify people with TB infection. The results from these TB infection tests are used to identify which individuals with a high risk of TB will benefit most from TB preventive treatment. Tuberculosis disease is treated with special antibiotics. Treatment is recommended for both TB infection and disease. The most common antibiotics used are: To be effective, medications need to be taken daily for 4–6 months. It is dangerous to stop the medications early or without medical advice as it can prompt TB bacteria in the body to become resistant to the antibiotics. TB that doesn’t respond to standard drugs is called drug-resistant TB and requires treatment with different medicines. Drug resistance emerges when TB medicines are used inappropriately, through incorrect prescription by health care providers, poor quality drugs, or patients stopping treatment prematurely. MDR-TB is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using other drugs, which tend to be more expensive and with more side effects. People exposed to MDR-TB may receive TB preventive treatment with levofloxacin. In some cases, extensively drug-resistant TB or XDR-TB can develop.

The shorter duration, lower pill burden and high efficacy of this novel regimen can help ease the burden on health systems and save precious resources to further expand the diagnostic and treatment coverage for all individuals in need. WHO recommends expanded access to all-oral regimens. People living with HIV are 12 times more likely to fall ill with TB disease than people without HIV. TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV. HIV and TB form a lethal combination, each accelerating the other's progress. In 2024, about 150 000 people died of HIV-associated TB. The percentage of people who fell ill with TB and had a documented HIV test result was 82% in 2024. This was a slight increase from 81% in 2023. The WHO African Region has the highest burden of HIV-associated TB. Globally in 2024, only 61% of the estimated number of people  living with HIV who developed TB received antiretroviral therapy (ART). WHO first recommended collaborative TB/HIV activities to reduce morbidity and mortality from HIV-associated TB in 2004. These activities include  bidirectional screening, prevention and treatment of infection and disease. Scale-up of TB treatment and ART since 2005 is estimated to have averted 9.8 million deaths. TB mostly affects adults in their most productive years. However, all age groups are at risk. Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2024, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in the WHO South-East Asia Region (34%), followed by the Western Pacific Region (27%) and the African Region (25%). Around 87% of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries, with two-thirds of the global total in India (25%), Indonesia (10%), the Philippines (6.8%), China (6.5%), Pakistan (6.3%), Nigeria (4.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (3.9%) and Bangladesh (3.6%). The top five countries accounted for 55% of the global total. Globally, about 50% of people treated for TB and their households face total costs (direct medical expenditures, non-medical expenditures and indirect costs such as income losses) that are catastrophic (>20% of total household income). This is far from the target of the WHO End TB Strategy of zero. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, undernutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco have a higher risk of falling ill. Globally in 2024, there were an estimated 0.97 million new TB cases that were attributable to undernutrition, 0.93 million to diabetes, 0.74 million to alcohol use disorders, 0.70 million to smoking and 0.57 million to HIV infection. US$ 22 billion are needed annually for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care to achieve global targets by 2027 agreed on at the 2023 UN high level-TB meeting. As in the past decade, most of the spending on TB services in 2024 (82%) was from domestic sources. In absolute terms, Brazil, China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa accounted for US$ 3.1 billion (64%) of the total of US$ 4.8 billion provided from domestic sources in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), international donor funding amounted to US$ 1.1 billion, having ranged from US$ 1.1 billion to US$ 1.2 billion in almost every year since 2015.

{"title": "Trachoma", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It is caused by an obligate intracellular bacterium called  Chlamydia trachomatis . The infection is transmitted by direct or indirect transfer of eye and nose discharges of infected people, particularly young children who harbour the principal reservoir of infection. These discharges can be spread by particular species of flies. In areas where trachoma is endemic, active (inflammatory) trachoma is common among preschool-aged children, with the proportion of such children affected sometimes being as high as 90%. Infection becomes less frequent and shorter in duration with increasing age. Infection is usually acquired when living in close proximity to others with active disease, and the family is the main setting for transmission. An individual’s immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently. After years of repeated infection, the inside of the eyelid can become so severely scarred (trachomatous conjunctival scarring) that it turns inwards and causes the eyelashes to rub against the eyeball (trachomatous trichiasis), resulting in constant pain and light intolerance. This and other alterations of the eye can lead to scarring of the cornea. Left untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible opacities, with resulting visual impairment or blindness. The age at which this occurs depends on several factors including local transmission intensity. In very highly endemic communities it can occur in childhood, though onset of visual impairment between the ages of 30 and 40 years is more typical. Visual impairment or blindness results in a worsening of the life experience of affected individuals and their families, who are normally already amongst the poorest of the poor. Women are blinded up to 4 times as often as men, probably due to their close contact with infected children and their resulting greater frequency of infection episodes. Environmental factors associated with more intense transmission of  C. trachomatis  include: Trachoma is a public health problem in many of the poorest and most rural areas of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East. It is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people. It causes about 1.4% of all blindness worldwide. Overall, Africa remains the most affected continent and the one with the most intensive control efforts. As of 12 November 2025, 27 countries – Benin, Burundi, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Fiji, Gambia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Ghana, India, Iraq, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Togo, Vanuatu and Viet Nam – had been validated by WHO as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. The burden of trachoma on affected individuals and communities is enormous. The economic cost in terms of lost productivity from blindness and visual impairment is estimated at US$ 2.9–5.3 billion annually, increasing to US$ 8 billion when trichiasis is included. Elimination programmes in endemic countries are being implemented using the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy. This consists of: Most endemic countries are accelerating the implementation of this strategy to achieve elimination targets. Data reported to WHO by Member States for 2024 show that 87 349 people with trachomatous trichiasis were provided with corrective surgery in that year, and 44.4 million people in endemic communities were treated with antibiotics to eliminate trachoma. Elimination efforts need to continue to ensure that we reach the target set by World Health Assembly resolution WHA 51.11, which is elimination of trachoma as a public health problem  (1) . Particularly important is the engagement of multiple actors involved in water, sanitation and socioeconomic development. WHO adopted the SAFE strategy in 1993. WHO’s mandate is to provide leadership and coordination to international efforts aiming to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem, and to report on progress towards that target. In 1996, WHO launched the WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020. The Alliance is a partnership which supports implementation of the SAFE strategy by Member States, and the strengthening of national capacity through epidemiological surveys, monitoring, surveillance, project evaluation, and resource mobilization. The World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA51.11 in 1998, targeting the global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem with 2020 as the target date. The  neglected tropical diseases road map 2021–2030 , endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2020 through its decision 73(33), sets 2030 as the new target date for global elimination.   (1)  Elimination of trachoma as a public health problem is defined as: (i) a prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis “unknown to the health system” of <0.2% in adults aged ≥15 years (approximately 1 case per 1000 total population), and (ii) a prevalence of trachomatous inflammation—follicular in children aged 1–9 years of less than 5%, sustained for at least two years in the absence of ongoing antibiotic mass treatment, in each formerly endemic district; plus (iii) the existence of a system able to identify and manage incident trachomatous trichiasis cases, using defined strategies, with evidence of appropriate financial resources to implement those strategies.", "Overview": "Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide.

Data reported to WHO by Member States for 2024 show that 87 349 people with trachomatous trichiasis were provided with corrective surgery in that year, and 44.4 million people in endemic communities were treated with antibiotics to eliminate trachoma. Elimination efforts need to continue to ensure that we reach the target set by World Health Assembly resolution WHA 51.11, which is elimination of trachoma as a public health problem  (1) . Particularly important is the engagement of multiple actors involved in water, sanitation and socioeconomic development. WHO adopted the SAFE strategy in 1993. WHO’s mandate is to provide leadership and coordination to international efforts aiming to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem, and to report on progress towards that target. In 1996, WHO launched the WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020. The Alliance is a partnership which supports implementation of the SAFE strategy by Member States, and the strengthening of national capacity through epidemiological surveys, monitoring, surveillance, project evaluation, and resource mobilization. The World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA51.11 in 1998, targeting the global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem with 2020 as the target date.

All forms of tobacco use are harmful, and there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco. Cigarette smoking is the most common form of tobacco use worldwide. Other tobacco products include waterpipe tobacco, cigars, cigarillos, heated tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, pipe tobacco, bidis and kreteks, and smokeless tobacco products. Around  80% of the 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide  live in low- and middle-income countries, where the burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest. Tobacco use contributes to poverty by diverting household spending from basic needs such as food and shelter to tobacco. This spending behaviour is difficult to curb because tobacco is so addictive. The economic costs of tobacco use are substantial and include significant health care costs for treating the diseases caused by tobacco use as well as the lost human capital that results from tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality. Good monitoring tracks the extent and character of the tobacco epidemic and indicates how best to tailor policies.

They contain the highly addictive substance nicotine, non-tobacco additives and are often flavoured. Despite claims of “risk reduction”, there is no evidence to demonstrate that HTPs are less harmful than conventional tobacco products. Many toxicants found in tobacco smoke are at significantly lower levels in HTP aerosol but HTP aerosol contains other toxicants found sometimes at higher levels than in tobacco smoke, such as glycidol, pyridine, dimethyl trisulfide, acetoin and methylglyoxal.  Further, some toxicants found in HTP aerosols are not found in conventional cigarette smoke and may have associated health effects. Additionally, these products are highly variable and some of the toxicants found in the emissions of these products are carcinogens.   More on heated tobacco products Electronic cigarettes (or e-cigarettes) are the most common form of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS) but there are others, such as e-cigars and e-pipes.

{"title": "Tetanus", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Tetanus is an acute infectious disease caused by spores of the bacterium  Clostridium tetani . The spores are found everywhere in the environment, particularly in soil, ash, intestinal tracts/feces of animals and humans, and on the surfaces of skin and rusty tools like nails, needles, barbed wire, etc. Being very resistant to heat and most antiseptics, the spores can survive for years. Anyone can get tetanus, but the disease is particularly common and serious in newborn babies and pregnant women who have not been sufficiently immunized with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines. Tetanus during pregnancy or within 6 weeks of the end of pregnancy is called maternal tetanus, and tetanus within the first 28 days of life is called neonatal tetanus.  The disease remains an important public health problem in many parts of the world, but especially in low-income countries or districts, where immunization coverage is low, and unclean birth practices are common. Neonatal tetanus occurs when nonsterile instruments are used to cut the umbilical cord or when contaminated material is used to cover the umbilical stump. Deliveries carried out by people with unclean hands or on a contaminated surface are also risk factors.  In 2018, approximately 25 000 newborns died from neonatal tetanus, a 97% reduction from 1988 when an estimated 787 000 newborn babies died of tetanus within their first month of life. However, there is increased risk of tetanus in adolescent and adult males who undergo circumcision due to waning immunity and limited opportunity for receiving booster doses in males in many countries. The incubation period of tetanus varies between 3 and 21 days after infection. Most cases occur within 14 days.  Symptoms can include:  In neonatal tetanus, symptoms include muscle spasms, which are often preceded by the newborn’s inability to suck or breastfeed, and excessive crying.  Tetanus is diagnosed on the basis of clinical features and does not require laboratory confirmation. The WHO definition of a confirmed neonatal tetanus case is an illness occurring in an infant who has the normal ability to suck and cry in the first 2 days of life, but who loses this ability between days 3 and 28 of life and becomes rigid or has spasms. The WHO definition of non-neonatal tetanus requires at least one of the following signs: a sustained spasm of the facial muscles in which the person appears to be grinning, or painful muscular contractions. Although this definition requires a history of injury or wound, tetanus may also occur in patients who are unable to recall a specific wound or injury. Tetanus is a medical emergency requiring: People who recover from tetanus do not have natural immunity and can be infected again, and therefore need to be immunized.  Tetanus can be prevented through immunization with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV), which are included in routine immunization programmes globally and administered during antenatal care contacts.  To be protected throughout life, WHO recommends that an individual receives 6 doses (3 primary plus 3 booster doses) of TTCV. The 3-dose primary series should begin as early as 6 weeks of age, with subsequent doses given with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. The 3 booster doses should preferably be given during the second year of life (12–23 months), at 4–7 years of age, and at 9–15 years of age. Ideally, there should be at least 4 years between booster doses. There are many kinds of vaccines used to protect against tetanus, all of which are combined with vaccines for other diseases: Neonatal tetanus can be prevented by immunizing women of reproductive age with TTCV, either during pregnancy or outside of pregnancy. Additionally, robust medical practices can also prevent tetanus disease including clean delivery and cord care during childbirth, and proper wound care for surgical and dental procedures.  In countries where national programmes have maintained high immunization coverage for several decades, tetanus incidence rates are very low. The global neonatal tetanus elimination goal was launched at the World Health Assembly in 1989 to reduce neonatal tetanus as a public health problem (defined as less than one case of neonatal tetanus per 1000 live births in every district) in all countries. The Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination (MNTE) Initiative was launched by UNICEF, WHO and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 1999, revitalizing the goal of MNTE as a public health problem.  As of July 2023, there are 11 countries that have not achieved MNTE. Once MNTE has been achieved, maintaining elimination will require continued strengthening of routine immunization activities for both pregnant women and children, maintaining and increasing access to clean deliveries, reliable neonatal tetanus surveillance, and introduction and/or strengthening of school-based immunization, where feasible. To sustain MNTE and protect all persons from tetanus, WHO recommends that 6 doses of tetanus-containing vaccine be given to all persons from childhood to adolescence.", "Overview": "Tetanus is an acute infectious disease caused by spores of the bacterium  Clostridium tetani . The spores are found everywhere in the environment, particularly in soil, ash, intestinal tracts/feces of animals and humans, and on the surfaces of skin and rusty tools like nails, needles, barbed wire, etc. Being very resistant to heat and most antiseptics, the spores can survive for years. Anyone can get tetanus, but the disease is particularly common and serious in newborn babies and pregnant women who have not been sufficiently immunized with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines. Tetanus during pregnancy or within 6 weeks of the end of pregnancy is called maternal tetanus, and tetanus within the first 28 days of life is called neonatal tetanus.  The disease remains an important public health problem in many parts of the world, but especially in low-income countries or districts, where immunization coverage is low, and unclean birth practices are common. Neonatal tetanus occurs when nonsterile instruments are used to cut the umbilical cord or when contaminated material is used to cover the umbilical stump. Deliveries carried out by people with unclean hands or on a contaminated surface are also risk factors.  In 2018, approximately 25 000 newborns died from neonatal tetanus, a 97% reduction from 1988 when an estimated 787 000 newborn babies died of tetanus within their first month of life. However, there is increased risk of tetanus in adolescent and adult males who undergo circumcision due to waning immunity and limited opportunity for receiving booster doses in males in many countries. The incubation period of tetanus varies between 3 and 21 days after infection. Most cases occur within 14 days.  Symptoms can include:  In neonatal tetanus, symptoms include muscle spasms, which are often preceded by the newborn’s inability to suck or breastfeed, and excessive crying.  Tetanus is diagnosed on the basis of clinical features and does not require laboratory confirmation. The WHO definition of a confirmed neonatal tetanus case is an illness occurring in an infant who has the normal ability to suck and cry in the first 2 days of life, but who loses this ability between days 3 and 28 of life and becomes rigid or has spasms. The WHO definition of non-neonatal tetanus requires at least one of the following signs: a sustained spasm of the facial muscles in which the person appears to be grinning, or painful muscular contractions. Although this definition requires a history of injury or wound, tetanus may also occur in patients who are unable to recall a specific wound or injury. Tetanus is a medical emergency requiring: People who recover from tetanus do not have natural immunity and can be infected again, and therefore need to be immunized.  Tetanus can be prevented through immunization with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV), which are included in routine immunization programmes globally and administered during antenatal care contacts.  To be protected throughout life, WHO recommends that an individual receives 6 doses (3 primary plus 3 booster doses) of TTCV. The 3-dose primary series should begin as early as 6 weeks of age, with subsequent doses given with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. The 3 booster doses should preferably be given during the second year of life (12–23 months), at 4–7 years of age, and at 9–15 years of age. Ideally, there should be at least 4 years between booster doses. There are many kinds of vaccines used to protect against tetanus, all of which are combined with vaccines for other diseases: Neonatal tetanus can be prevented by immunizing women of reproductive age with TTCV, either during pregnancy or outside of pregnancy. Additionally, robust medical practices can also prevent tetanus disease including clean delivery and cord care during childbirth, and proper wound care for surgical and dental procedures.  In countries where national programmes have maintained high immunization coverage for several decades, tetanus incidence rates are very low. The global neonatal tetanus elimination goal was launched at the World Health Assembly in 1989 to reduce neonatal tetanus as a public health problem (defined as less than one case of neonatal tetanus per 1000 live births in every district) in all countries. The Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination (MNTE) Initiative was launched by UNICEF, WHO and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 1999, revitalizing the goal of MNTE as a public health problem.

{"title": "Syphilis", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Syphilis is a preventable and curable bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI). If untreated, it can cause serious health issues. Many people with syphilis do not have symptoms or do not notice them.  Syphilis is transmitted during oral, vaginal and anal sex, in pregnancy and through blood transfusion. Syphilis in pregnancy may lead to stillbirth, newborn death and babies born with syphilis (congenital syphilis). Correct and consistent use of condoms during sex can prevent syphilis.  Rapid tests can provide results in a few minutes, which allows treatment initiation on the same clinic visit. Many people with syphilis do not notice any symptoms. They can also go unnoticed by healthcare providers. Untreated, syphilis lasts many years. Syphilis has several stages. Primary syphilis (first stage): Syphilis can be transmitted through chancres if they are not properly covered by a condom during sexual contact.  Secondary syphilis: Latent syphilis: Babies born with syphilis can experience: Some of these symptoms may only be noticed later in life. Syphilis is a preventable disease. Using condoms consistently and correctly is the best way to prevent syphilis and many other STIs. Syphilis can also spread through contact with other areas of the body not covered by a condom, including genitals, anus and mouth. People at higher risk of infection should be tested at least once a year.  Pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the first prenatal care visit and treated right away if the test result is positive. Congenital syphilis can only be prevented by diagnosing and treating the mother with penicillin.  People diagnosed with syphilis should  notify their sexual partners  to prevent new infections. Syphilis diagnosis is based on the person’s clinical and sexual history, physical examination, laboratory testing and sometimes radiology, as symptoms are not common or noticeable.  Syphilis is caused by the bacterium  Treponema pallidum . Laboratory tests for syphilis include direct detection of  T. pallidum  through a microscope or indirect methods such as blood tests.  Rapid tests  are also available and can provide results in minutes, facilitating immediate treatment initiation. Identifying asymptomatic infection through laboratory or rapid tests and providing adequate treatment of positive cases will prevent further transmission and complications, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital syphilis.  There are currently no diagnostic tests for  congenital syphilis . All live or stillborn infants of women with syphilis should be examined for evidence of congenital syphilis. For live-born infants, clinical examination, radiology (if available) and laboratory tests at birth and follow up tests will help to define treatment.  Syphilis is treatable and curable. People who suspect they may have syphilis should speak to their health-care provider. The early stage of syphilis is treated with a benzathine penicillin (BPG) injection. BPG is the first line treatment for syphilis and the only WHO-recommended treatment for pregnant women with syphilis. As second line treatment, doctors may also use doxycycline, ceftriaxone or azithromycin, which are antibiotic medicines.  BPG is also used to treat later stages of syphilis, but more doses are required. Doses are usually given once per week for three weeks, including when it is not possible to identify the stage of infection. BPG is the only medicine that can prevent syphilis from being passed from a mother to baby. Babies born with syphilis (congenital syphilis), or babies whose mother had untreated syphilis, need to be treated right away to avoid serious health problems. Syphilis is transmitted during oral, anal or vaginal sex through contact with infectious lesions, and also during pregnancy through the placenta. Transmission typically occurs during early stages of the disease, i.e., up to 2 years after infection.  Syphilis increases the risk of acquiring HIV infection by approximately two-fold, as well as of other STIs, such as gonorrhoea, chlamydia, genital herpes, among others.  Without treatment, the tertiary phase of syphilis may lead to several complications decades after infection. At this stage, syphilis can affect multiple organs and systems, including brain, nerves, eyes, liver, heart, blood vessels, bones and joints. Tertiary syphilis can also cause death.  Neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis and otosyphilis can occur at any stage of the disease.  Neurosyphilis can cause strong headache, serious muscular problems and mental health issues, including dementia.  Ocular syphilis can cause pain in the eye, blurry vision, sensitivity to light or blindness.  Otosyphilis affects the person’s hearing and/or balance.  Untreated syphilis in pregnancy may lead to severe negative consequences, such as stillbirth, neonatal death, prematurity, low birth weight and life-long health problems to the infected infant.

{"title": "Suicide", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Every year 727 000 people take their own life and there are many more people who make suicide attempts. Every suicide is a tragedy that affects families, communities and entire countries and has long-lasting effects on the people left behind. Suicide occurs throughout the lifespan and was the third leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds globally in 2021. Suicide does not just occur in high-income countries but is a global phenomenon in all regions of the world. In fact, close to three quarters (73%) of global suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries in 2021. Suicide is a serious public health problem that requires a public health response. With timely, evidence-based and often low-cost interventions, suicides can be prevented. For national responses to be effective, a comprehensive multisectoral suicide prevention strategy is needed. The link between suicide and mental disorders (in particular, depression and alcohol use disorders) and a previous suicide attempt is well established in high-income countries. However, many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems, relationship disputes, or chronic pain and illness. In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse or loss and a sense of isolation are strongly associated with suicidal behaviour. Suicide rates are also high among vulnerable groups who experience discrimination, such as refugees and migrants; indigenous peoples; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex (LGBTI) persons; and prisoners. There are several measures that can be taken at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and self-harm. LIVE LIFE, WHO’s initiative for suicide prevention, recommends the following key effective evidence-based interventions: These need to go hand-in-hand with the following foundational pillars: situation analysis, multisectoral collaboration, awareness raising, capacity building, financing, surveillance and monitoring and evaluation. Suicide prevention efforts require coordination and collaboration among multiple sectors of society, including the health sector and other sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defence, politics and the media. These efforts must be comprehensive and integrated given the multifaceted nature of suicide. Stigma, particularly surrounding mental disorders and suicide, means many people thinking of taking their own life or who have attempted suicide are not seeking help and are therefore not getting the help they need. The prevention of suicide has not been adequately addressed due to a lack of awareness of suicide as a major public health problem and the taboo in many societies to openly discuss it. To date, only a few countries have included suicide prevention among their health priorities and only 38 countries report having a national suicide prevention strategy. Raising community awareness and breaking down the taboo is important for countries to make progress in preventing suicide. Globally, the availability and quality of data on suicide and self-harm is poor. Only some 80 WHO Member States have good-quality vital registration data that can be used directly to estimate suicide rates. This problem of poor-quality mortality data is not unique to suicide, but given the stigma surrounding suicide – and the illegality of suicidal behaviour in some countries – it is likely that under-reporting and misclassification are greater problems for suicide than for most other causes of death. Improved surveillance and monitoring of suicide and self-harm are required for effective suicide prevention strategies. Cross-national differences in the patterns of suicide, and changes in the rates, characteristics and methods of suicide, highlight the need for each country to improve the comprehensiveness, quality and timeliness of their suicide-related data. This includes vital registration of suicide, hospital-based registries of self-harm and nationally representative surveys collecting information about self-reported self-harm. The urgency to act to prevent suicides has been recognized and prioritized at the highest levels. The reduction of the suicide rate is an indicator in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (the only indicator for mental health), WHO’s General Programme of Work and WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030.  The first WHO world suicide report,  Preventing suicide: a global imperative , published in 2014, aimed to increase the awareness of the public health significance of suicide and suicide attempts and to make suicide prevention a high priority on the global public health agenda.

Through the  LIVE LIFE initiative , governments are encouraged and supported to implement a suite of evidence-based interventions and foundational pillars for suicide prevention.", "Overview": "Every year 727 000 people take their own life and there are many more people who make suicide attempts. Every suicide is a tragedy that affects families, communities and entire countries and has long-lasting effects on the people left behind. Suicide occurs throughout the lifespan and was the third leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds globally in 2021. Suicide does not just occur in high-income countries but is a global phenomenon in all regions of the world. In fact, close to three quarters (73%) of global suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries in 2021. Suicide is a serious public health problem that requires a public health response. With timely, evidence-based and often low-cost interventions, suicides can be prevented. For national responses to be effective, a comprehensive multisectoral suicide prevention strategy is needed. The link between suicide and mental disorders (in particular, depression and alcohol use disorders) and a previous suicide attempt is well established in high-income countries. However, many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems, relationship disputes, or chronic pain and illness. In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse or loss and a sense of isolation are strongly associated with suicidal behaviour. Suicide rates are also high among vulnerable groups who experience discrimination, such as refugees and migrants; indigenous peoples; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex (LGBTI) persons; and prisoners. There are several measures that can be taken at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and self-harm. LIVE LIFE, WHO’s initiative for suicide prevention, recommends the following key effective evidence-based interventions: These need to go hand-in-hand with the following foundational pillars: situation analysis, multisectoral collaboration, awareness raising, capacity building, financing, surveillance and monitoring and evaluation. Suicide prevention efforts require coordination and collaboration among multiple sectors of society, including the health sector and other sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defence, politics and the media. These efforts must be comprehensive and integrated given the multifaceted nature of suicide. Stigma, particularly surrounding mental disorders and suicide, means many people thinking of taking their own life or who have attempted suicide are not seeking help and are therefore not getting the help they need. The prevention of suicide has not been adequately addressed due to a lack of awareness of suicide as a major public health problem and the taboo in many societies to openly discuss it. To date, only a few countries have included suicide prevention among their health priorities and only 38 countries report having a national suicide prevention strategy. Raising community awareness and breaking down the taboo is important for countries to make progress in preventing suicide. Globally, the availability and quality of data on suicide and self-harm is poor. Only some 80 WHO Member States have good-quality vital registration data that can be used directly to estimate suicide rates. This problem of poor-quality mortality data is not unique to suicide, but given the stigma surrounding suicide – and the illegality of suicidal behaviour in some countries – it is likely that under-reporting and misclassification are greater problems for suicide than for most other causes of death. Improved surveillance and monitoring of suicide and self-harm are required for effective suicide prevention strategies. Cross-national differences in the patterns of suicide, and changes in the rates, characteristics and methods of suicide, highlight the need for each country to improve the comprehensiveness, quality and timeliness of their suicide-related data. This includes vital registration of suicide, hospital-based registries of self-harm and nationally representative surveys collecting information about self-reported self-harm. The urgency to act to prevent suicides has been recognized and prioritized at the highest levels. The reduction of the suicide rate is an indicator in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (the only indicator for mental health), WHO’s General Programme of Work and WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030.

{"title": "Stroke", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "A stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, either due to a blockage or bleeding. This lack of blood flow can lead to brain cell death and serious complications. Strokes can be fatal and need immediate treatment. The types of strokes are: There are by modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for stroke. Modifiable risk factors are: Non‑modifiable risk factors are: The following symptoms can be signs of stroke: When a stroke is suspected, it should be treated as a health emergency. Rapid care is essential. Immediate diagnostic imagining (a CT or MRI scan) should be carried out as soon as possible. In the case of ischaemic stroke, thrombolytic therapy (e.g. tPA) should be carried out as soon as possible, and within hours of symptom onset. An endovascular thrombectomy may be indicated, depending on the severity and location of symptoms. In the case of haemorrhagic stroke, management includes action to control blood pressure; intensive care in a specialized stroke unit; and possibly surgical intervention. Admission to a specialist stroke unit with rehabilitation services enhances outcomes and decreases mortality and morbidity. Lifestyle changes and effective management of high blood pressure can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Everyone can reduce their risk of stroke by: Action can also be taken for individuals at particular risk: Stroke can lead to a wide range of complications, including serious effects on the brain, heart and other parts of the body. Acute complications (that appear within days to weeks) are: Long-term complications (months to years) are: Rehabilitation is a critical component of stroke care and recovery. It aims to help individuals regain functional abilities, improve quality of life, and restore independence to the greatest extent possible. Stroke rehabilitation should begin as soon as the person is medically stable – ideally within the first few days after the stroke. Rehabilitation involves a multidisciplinary approach, including: The World Health Organization (WHO) helps countries reduce the burden of stroke and improve prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. In 2024, WHO published a  framework for organizing care for stroke and acute coronary syndrome . It offers guidance on timely diagnosis, effective treatment, and rehabilitation, helping countries improve services and reduce deaths and disability. WHO also supports integrating stroke care into broader health strategies and universal health coverage, ensuring services are accessible and sustainable. The  WHO STEPwise approach to stroke surveillance  manual helps countries collect reliable data on stroke cases and outcomes, supporting evidence-based policies. Stroke is also part of WHO’s broader work on neurological disorders. The  Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders (2022–2031)  promotes better access to care and improved quality of life for people with conditions like stroke. Similarly, stroke rehabilitation care is included in the  WHO Package of interventions for rehabilitation: module 3: neurological conditions . Managing high blood pressure is key to preventing stroke. WHO’s 2021  guideline for the pharmacological treatment of hypertension in adults  supports health systems in treating hypertension effectively. To strengthen heart and stroke prevention, WHO launched the HEARTS initiative in 2016. It promotes healthy lifestyles, access to medicines, and team-based care. Stroke remains a major global health challenge.

Early diagnosis is crucial for managing the disease and preventing complications. Treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms and preventing crises, with advanced therapies like gene therapy offering hope for a cure. SCD is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which provides instructions for making haemoglobin. This mutation leads to the production of abnormal haemoglobin known as haemoglobin S. When a person inherits two copies of the haemoglobin S gene (one from each parent), they develop SCD. Individuals with one normal haemoglobin gene and one haemoglobin S gene have sickle-cell trait (SCT) and usually do not exhibit symptoms but can pass the gene to their offspring. Sickle-cell anemia is typically diagnosed through a blood test. These tests look for the abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) that characterizes the disease.

{"title": "Rabies", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Rabies is a vaccine-preventable, zoonotic, viral disease affecting the central nervous system. In up to 99% of the human rabies cases, dogs are responsible for virus transmission. Children between the age of 5 and 14 years are frequent victims.  Rabies infects mammals, including dogs, cats, livestock and wildlife. Rabies spreads to people and animals via saliva, usually through  bites , scratches, or direct contact with mucosa (e.g. eyes, mouth, or open wounds). Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal.  The global cost of rabies is estimated to be around US$ 8.6 billion per year including lost lives and livelihoods, medical care and associated costs, as well as uncalculated psychological trauma.  Rabies is present on all continents except Antarctica. Globally there are an estimated 59 000 deaths from rabies annually; however, due to underreporting, documented case numbers often differ from the estimate.   Rabies, a neglected tropical diseases (NTD), predominantly affecting marginalized populations. Although effective human vaccines and immunoglobulins exist for rabies, these are often inaccessible or unaffordable to those in need.  As of 2018, the average estimated cost of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)  was US$ 108  (along with travel costs and loss of income), which can be a financial burden on those earning US$ 1–2 per person, daily.  Over 29 million people worldwide receive human rabies vaccine annually.  In the Americas, where dog-mediated rabies is mostly controlled, hematophagous (blood-feeding) bats are now the primary source of human rabies. Bat-mediated rabies is also an emerging public health threat in Australia and parts of western Europe.  Human deaths following exposure to foxes, raccoons, skunks, and other wild mammals are very rare, and bites from rodents are not known to transmit rabies. Contraction of rabies through inhalation of virus-containing aerosols, consumption of raw meat or milk of infected animals, or through organ transplantation is extremely rare.  Human-to-human transmission through bites or saliva is theoretically possible but has never been confirmed.  The incubation period for rabies is typically 2–3 months but may vary from one week to one year, depending on factors such as the location of virus entry and the viral load. Initial symptoms of rabies include generic signs like fever, pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensations at the wound site. As the virus moves to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. Clinical rabies in people can be managed but very rarely cured, and not without severe neurological deficits.  There are two forms of rabies: Currently there are no WHO-approved diagnostic tools for detecting rabies infection before the onset of clinical disease.  Clinical diagnosis of rabies is difficult without a reliable history of contact with a rabid animal or specific symptoms of hydrophobia or aerophobia.  Accurate risk assessment is crucial for deciding on PEP administration.  Once symptoms emerge, and death is inevitable, offering comprehensive and compassionate palliative care is recommended. Postmortem confirmation of rabies infection is done by various diagnostic techniques that detect whole viruses, viral antigens, or nucleic acids in infected tissues (brain, skin or saliva) (Laboratory techniques in rabies  Vol. 1  and  Vol. 2 ).  Where possible, the biting animal should be tested.   Vaccinating dogs, including puppies, through mass dog vaccination programs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people because it stops the transmission at its source.  Culling free roaming dogs is not effective in controlling rabies. Public education for both children and adults on dog behaviour and bite prevention, what to do if bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal, and responsible pet ownership are essential extensions of rabies vaccination programmes.   Effective vaccines are available to immunize people both before and after potential exposures. As listed under the  WHO - Prequalification of Medical Products , as of 2024, there are only 3 WHO pre-qualified human rabies vaccines available globally:  RABIVAX-S  by Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd.,  VaxiRab N  by Zydus Lifesciences Limited, and  VERORAB  by Sanofi Pasteur. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)  is recommended for people in high-risk occupations (laboratory workers handling live rabies and related viruses) and people whose professional or personal activities might lead to direct contact with infected animals (animal disease control staff and wildlife rangers). PrEP might be indicated before recreation or travel in some areas, and for people living in remote, highly rabies-endemic areas with limited local access to rabies biologicals.  Note that PrEP does not replace the need for PEP. Any person exposed to a suspected rabid animal should still seek post exposure care.   Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)  is the emergency response to a rabies exposure. This prevents the virus from entering the central nervous system. A well performed  wound risk assessment and PEP protocol  consists of: Depending on the severity of exposure, administration of a full PEP course is recommended as follows:   NB: Category II and III exposures require human rabies vaccination. WHO recommends that all human  rabies vaccines comply with WHO standards .   Deployment of poor-quality rabies vaccines has led to public health failures in several countries. As detailed in the  guidance on PEP administration , WHO recommends moving from intramuscular (IM) to intradermal (ID) administration of human rabies vaccines.  Intradermal administration  reduces the amount of necessary vaccine and number of doses, therefore  reducing costs by 60–80% , without compromising safety or efficacy.  Fewer doses also promote patient compliance with the recommended regimen.  Rabies is included in  WHO’s 2021–2030 Roadmap for the global control of NTDs , which sets regional, progressive targets for the global strategic plan to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 (see also:  Zero by 30 ).

Where possible, the biting animal should be tested.   Vaccinating dogs, including puppies, through mass dog vaccination programs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people because it stops the transmission at its source.  Culling free roaming dogs is not effective in controlling rabies. Public education for both children and adults on dog behaviour and bite prevention, what to do if bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal, and responsible pet ownership are essential extensions of rabies vaccination programmes.   Effective vaccines are available to immunize people both before and after potential exposures. As listed under the  WHO - Prequalification of Medical Products , as of 2024, there are only 3 WHO pre-qualified human rabies vaccines available globally:  RABIVAX-S  by Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd.,  VaxiRab N  by Zydus Lifesciences Limited, and  VERORAB  by Sanofi Pasteur. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)  is recommended for people in high-risk occupations (laboratory workers handling live rabies and related viruses) and people whose professional or personal activities might lead to direct contact with infected animals (animal disease control staff and wildlife rangers). PrEP might be indicated before recreation or travel in some areas, and for people living in remote, highly rabies-endemic areas with limited local access to rabies biologicals.  Note that PrEP does not replace the need for PEP. Any person exposed to a suspected rabid animal should still seek post exposure care.   Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)  is the emergency response to a rabies exposure. This prevents the virus from entering the central nervous system. A well performed  wound risk assessment and PEP protocol  consists of: Depending on the severity of exposure, administration of a full PEP course is recommended as follows:   NB: Category II and III exposures require human rabies vaccination. WHO recommends that all human  rabies vaccines comply with WHO standards .   Deployment of poor-quality rabies vaccines has led to public health failures in several countries. As detailed in the  guidance on PEP administration , WHO recommends moving from intramuscular (IM) to intradermal (ID) administration of human rabies vaccines.  Intradermal administration  reduces the amount of necessary vaccine and number of doses, therefore  reducing costs by 60–80% , without compromising safety or efficacy.  Fewer doses also promote patient compliance with the recommended regimen.  Rabies is included in  WHO’s 2021–2030 Roadmap for the global control of NTDs , which sets regional, progressive targets for the global strategic plan to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 (see also:  Zero by 30 ). This entails:", "Symptoms": "The incubation period for rabies is typically 2–3 months but may vary from one week to one year, depending on factors such as the location of virus entry and the viral load. Initial symptoms of rabies include generic signs like fever, pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensations at the wound site. As the virus moves to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. Clinical rabies in people can be managed but very rarely cured, and not without severe neurological deficits.  There are two forms of rabies: Currently there are no WHO-approved diagnostic tools for detecting rabies infection before the onset of clinical disease.  Clinical diagnosis of rabies is difficult without a reliable history of contact with a rabid animal or specific symptoms of hydrophobia or aerophobia.

{"title": "Post-traumatic stress disorder", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Many people feel extreme fear during or after witnessing or experiencing potentially traumatic events, such as war, accidents, natural disasters or sexual violence. Most people exposed to such events will experience distress but will recover naturally with time. Some people continue to experience a range of mental health conditions that can persist for months or even years, including PTSD,  depressive disorders ,  anxiety disorders  and substance use disorders.  Around 70% of people globally will experience a potentially traumatic event during their lifetime  (1) , But only a minority (5.6%) will go on to develop PTSD  (2).  An estimated 3.9% of the world population has experienced PTSD at some point in their lives  (2) .   The likelihood of developing PTSD varies depending on the type of traumatic event experienced. For example, rates of PTSD are more than three times (15.3%) higher among people exposed to violent conflict or war  (3) . PTSD rates are especially high following sexual violence  ( 1 ) .  Up to 40% of people with PTSD recover within one year  (1).  There are many effective treatments for PTSD, yet only 1 in 4 people with PTSD in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) report seeking any form of treatment  (2) . Barriers to care include lack of awareness that PTSD can be treated, lack of availability of mental health services, social stigma and lack of trained mental health care providers.  Experiencing distress or other mental health difficulties after a potentially traumatic event is common but does not mean someone is experiencing PTSD.  Someone experiences PTSD when they have symptoms  re-experiencing the event, avoid reminders of the event and experience symptoms of heightened arousal that cause significant distress, and interfere with daily activities and family, social, school or working life.  People with PTSD have repeated and unwanted recollections of the traumatic event(s), which make them feel as if the event(s) is happening all over again. These memories are accompanied by intense fear or horror. They may be experienced as images, sounds (e.g. gunfire), smells (e.g. the odour of an assailant) or other sensations. These recollections might occur through intrusive memories, nightmares, or, in severe cases, flashbacks. During flashbacks, the person might momentarily believe and act as if they were back at the time of the event, experiencing it again.  People with PTSD avoid situations, activities, thoughts or memories that remind them of the traumatic event(s). They may even avoid talking about the event(s) with their family or health care providers. People usually use these strategies to try to avoid distressing recollections. Yet avoidance strategies may inadvertently intensify re-experiencing symptoms over time and thus perpetuate the presence of PTSD. People with PTSD may experience a heightened sense of danger, even when they are not actually at risk. This can involve them being much more vigilant than usual, for example constantly scanning their surroundings for potential threats or feeling the need to sit with their back against a wall in public places. They may be more easily startled or jumpy, reacting with excessive fear to sudden movements or loud noises.  Symptoms of PTSD typically begin immediately after or within one month of a traumatic event. In younger children, symptoms are often behavioural and can include re-enacting the traumatic event during play or in drawings. Children often unjustly blame themselves for what happened. The experience of PTSD can also vary across cultures. For instance, in some cultures, it may be more acceptable to express anger about the event, making this a more prominent experience. In other cultures, people with PTSD may more commonly have physical complaints with unclear causes, such as headaches or gastrointestinal symptoms.  People with PTSD may also have  depressive disorder ,  anxiety disorder s and  substance use disorders  as well as  suicidal thoughts and behaviours . Many of the effects of PTSD (such as physical tension or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for physical diseases such as cardiovascular disease. PTSD, like other mental health conditions, results from interacting social, psychological and biological factors. Anyone can experience PTSD after a potentially traumatic event, but people who have previously experienced traumatic events are more susceptible. Women are more likely to experience PTSD than men. Other factors, including a family history of mental health conditions, younger age, and lower levels of education, can also increase the likelihood of developing PTSD after a potentially traumatic experience. The nature of the event experienced can also affect the chances of developing PTSD. For example, experiencing ongoing or repeated potentially traumatic events, developing a serious physical injury during the event(s), or witnessing harm to others can all increase risk. Receiving social support following  potentially traumatic events can reduce the risk for PTSD.  There are many effective treatments for people with PTSD. Evidence-based psychological interventions are the first choice treatments and can be delivered to individuals or groups, in person or online. Some may also be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps. Psychological interventions can help people learn new ways of thinking and coping that may reduce their symptoms. They can help people manage difficult situations and address the events, people or places that trigger their traumatic memories.  The psychological interventions with the most evidence for effective treatment of PTSD are those based on cognitive behavioural therapy with a trauma focus and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Many of these involve exposure techniques, in which the person is asked to recall, narrate or imagine the traumatic event(s) so that they are exposed to their memories within a safe and supportive environment. Psychological interventions for PTSD may also include real or imagined exposure to triggers that may evoke traumatic memories.  Self-care can have an important role in supporting treatment for PTSD.

Some may also be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps. Psychological interventions can help people learn new ways of thinking and coping that may reduce their symptoms. They can help people manage difficult situations and address the events, people or places that trigger their traumatic memories.  The psychological interventions with the most evidence for effective treatment of PTSD are those based on cognitive behavioural therapy with a trauma focus and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Many of these involve exposure techniques, in which the person is asked to recall, narrate or imagine the traumatic event(s) so that they are exposed to their memories within a safe and supportive environment. Psychological interventions for PTSD may also include real or imagined exposure to triggers that may evoke traumatic memories.  Self-care can have an important role in supporting treatment for PTSD.

{"title": "Post COVID-19 condition (long COVID)", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "COVID-19 can lead to serious long-term effects, known as post COVID-19 condition (PCC). It is also commonly referred to as long COVID.  Post COVID-19 condition is characterized by a range of symptoms which usually start within 3 months of the initial COVID-19 illness and last at least 2 months. PCC can affect a person’s ability to perform daily activities such as work or household chores and restrict social participation. Millions of people have been affected with post COVID-19 condition since the beginning of the pandemic  (1) . Global estimates indicate that 6 in 100 people with COVID-19 develop post COVID-19 condition. Estimates largely come from people who suffered COVID-19 early in the pandemic (in the first two years), and there is a very large variation in estimates  (2) .  More recent research shows the chances of developing post COVID-19 condition have reduced, but these data are limited and mostly from high-income countries  (3) . However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19 is widely circulating and post COVID-19 condition remains a substantial threat and ongoing challenge to global public health.  Anyone who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 can develop post COVID-19 condition. Some people have higher risk. These include women, older adults, smokers, those who are overweight or obese or have pre-existing chronic health problems. Repeated infections and severe COVID-19 needing hospitalization or ICU admission also increase the risk  (4) . We see higher numbers of post COVID-19 condition sufferers among people with disabilities, and where health disparity and access to health care is a problem  (5) . Research is ongoing to better understand what causes post COVID-19 condition. Almost any organ can be affected, including the heart and blood vessels, lungs, nervous system, gut and endocrine (hormone) system. In those with post COVID-19 condition, researchers have found evidence of persistence of SARS-CoV2 virus in the body, of altered immune responses and autoimmunity, and of formation of microscopic blood clots (micro-thrombosis), among other problems  (6) .  Over 200 different symptoms have been reported by people with post COVID-19 condition. Common symptoms include:  Impaired sleep, depression and anxiety also occur  (5) . These symptoms might persist from their initial illness or develop after their recovery. Symptoms can be mild to severely debilitating, and affect someone’s capacity to work, perform their daily activities or do exercise. With increasing understanding of post COVID-19 condition, some clinical patterns have become clearer. There are symptoms which tend to occur together, for example dizziness, palpitations, light-headedness on standing, and exercise intolerance (related to postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), symptoms of post exertional malaise, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)  (7) .  Other medical conditions can occur more often than usual after having COVID-19. These include kidney impairment, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and mental health disorders, among other conditions  (8) .  Post COVID-19 condition can affect the ability to work and may lead to loss of productivity, and a reduction in income and quality of life. Ongoing medical needs of people with the condition may stretch existing health systems.  Symptoms of post COVID-19 condition generally improve over time, typically 4–9 months. Approximately 15 in 100 people still have symptoms at 12 months as per global estimates from 2022  (2) .  The individual needs of patients with post COVID-19 condition vary. At the present time, there remains limited research on treatments and a lack of large studies to understand the most effective treatments. However, doctors and their patients may make individualized treatment decisions based on knowledge from similar medical conditions. Health-care providers may offer medications for symptomatic relief as needed. Additionally, newly diagnosed medical problems occurring after COVID-19 frequently have well-established treatments, for example kidney disease or stroke. Many symptoms and functional impairment can be managed effectively by   rehabilitation , and with careful communication between primary care practitioners and medical specialists.  Education about the importance of quality rest and sleep and skills training on energy conservation techniques can help patients manage their symptoms better. Health-care providers can discuss with patients about self-management strategies to respond promptly to a flare-up or relapse, such as identifying possible triggers, temporarily reducing activity levels, monitoring symptoms over time, and not returning to usual activity levels until the flare-up has resolved. Use of assistive devices and environmental modifications at work and home may be needed in some instances.  People can be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 multiple times. Each time, they have a risk of developing post COVID-19 condition. Therefore, risk reduction with preventive measures such as the use of masks, personal hygiene and ventilation in high-risk situations continues to be important. Receiving two doses of vaccination appears to reduce the likelihood chance of developing post COVID-19 condition  (9) .  WHO first started work on post COVID-19 condition in the first wave of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when reports began to emerge that some patients had persistent symptoms weeks or months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. To better understand this phenomenon, WHO met with patient advocates, researchers, health-care providers and public health professionals and by September 2020, established emergency international classification of disease (ICD) codes for post COVID-19 condition.   Since then, WHO has developed a  clinical case definition of post COVID-19 condition  to recognize the condition and its impact on people’s lives. This definition was developed by patients, researchers and clinical experts, representing all WHO regions, with the understanding that the definition may change as new evidence emerges and our understanding of the consequences of COVID-19 evolves.  A separate   clinical case definition for post COVID-19 condition in children and adolescents  is also available.  WHO has been organizing webinars on post COVID-19 condition since February 2021 to expand understanding of the condition and its impact on patients’ lives, and foster research and collaboration. A  global webinar series  on the medical management of post COVID-19 condition is organized each month and has been running since 2023.  A  WHO Guideline Development Group  consisting of global experts, frontline providers and affected individuals is presently at work on guidelines on diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation in post COVID-19 condition.  We advocate for governments and funders to support research on post COVID-19 condition in the interest of improved understanding of this condition around the world, not just in high-income countries, and design optimal clinical care for patients. National authorities are encouraged to plan and budget for multidisciplinary post COVID-19 condition programmes and to ensure equitable access to relevant therapies.     References", "Overview": "COVID-19 can lead to serious long-term effects, known as post COVID-19 condition (PCC).

{"title": "Pneumonia in children", "summary": null, "sections": {"Causes": "Pneumonia is caused by several infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria and fungi. The most common are the following. Pneumonia can be spread in several ways. The viruses and bacteria that are commonly found in a child's nose or throat can infect the lungs if they are inhaled. They may also spread via air-borne droplets from a cough or sneeze. In addition, pneumonia may spread through blood, especially during and shortly after birth. More research needs to be done on the different pathogens causing pneumonia and the ways they are transmitted, as this is of critical importance for treatment and prevention. The presenting features of viral and bacterial pneumonia are similar. However, the symptoms of viral pneumonia may be more numerous than the symptoms of bacterial pneumonia. In children under 5 years of age who have cough and/or difficult breathing, with or without fever, pneumonia is diagnosed by the presence of either fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing where their chest moves in or retracts during inhalation (in a healthy person, the chest expands during inhalation). Wheezing is more common in viral infections. Very severely ill infants may be unable to feed or drink and may also experience unconsciousness, hypothermia and convulsions. While most healthy children can fight the infection with their natural defences, children whose immune systems are compromised are at higher risk of developing pneumonia. A child's immune system may be weakened by malnutrition or undernourishment, especially in infants who are not exclusively breastfed.  Pre-existing illnesses, such as symptomatic HIV infections and measles, also increase a child's risk of contracting pneumonia.  The following environmental factors also increase a child's susceptibility to pneumonia: Pneumonia should be treated with antibiotics. The antibiotic of choice  for first line treatment  is amoxicillin dispersible tablets. Most cases of pneumonia require oral antibiotics, which are often prescribed at a health centre. These cases can also be diagnosed and treated with inexpensive oral antibiotics at the community level by trained community health workers. Hospitalization is recommended only for severe cases of pneumonia. Preventing pneumonia in children is an essential component of a strategy to reduce child mortality. Immunization against Hib, pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough (pertussis) is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia.  Adequate nutrition is key to improving children's natural defences, starting with exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. In addition to being effective in preventing pneumonia, it also helps to reduce the length of the illness if a child does become ill. Addressing environmental factors such as indoor air pollution (by providing affordable clean indoor stoves, for example) and encouraging good hygiene in crowded homes also reduces the number of children who fall ill with pneumonia.  In children infected with HIV, the antibiotic cotrimoxazole is given daily to decrease the risk of contracting pneumonia. The WHO and UNICEF integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea  (GAPPD) aims to accelerate pneumonia control with a combination of interventions to protect, prevent and treat pneumonia in children with actions to: Several countries including Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia have developed district, state and national plans to intensify actions for the control of pneumonia and diarrhoea. Many more have integrated diarrhoea and pneumonia specific action into their national child health and child survival strategies.

{"title": "Plague", "summary": null, "sections": {"Signs and symptoms": "People infected with plague usually develop acute febrile disease with other non-specific systemic symptoms after an incubation period of one to seven days, such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, and weakness, vomiting and nausea.  There are two main forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic and pneumonic.\r\n     As an animal disease, plague is found in all continents, except Oceania. There is a risk of human plague wherever the presence of plague natural foci (the bacteria, an animal reservoir and a vector) and human population co-exist. Plague epidemics have occurred in Africa, Asia, and South America; but since the 1990s, most human cases have occurred in Africa. The three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, and Peru. In Madagascar cases of bubonic plague are reported nearly every year, during the epidemic season (between September and April). Confirmation of plague requires lab testing. The best practice is to identify Y. pestis from a sample of pus from a bubo, blood or sputum. A specific Y. pestis antigen can be detected by different techniques. One of them is a laboratory validated rapid dipstick test now widely used in Africa and South America, with the support of WHO. Untreated pneumonic plague can be rapidly fatal, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential for survival and reduction of complications. Antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective against plague if patients are diagnosed in time. Pneumonic plague can be fatal within 18 to 24 hours of disease onset if left untreated, but common antibiotics for enterobacteria (gram negative rods) can effectively cure the disease if they are delivered early. Preventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and advising them to take precautions against flea bites and not to handle animal carcasses. Generally people should be advised to avoid direct contact with infected body fluids and tissues. When handling potentially infected patients and collecting specimens, standard precautions should apply.  WHO does not recommend vaccination, except for high-risk groups (such as laboratory personnel who are constantly exposed to the risk of contamination, and health care workers). Surveillance and control requires investigating animal and flea species implicated in the plague cycle in the region and developing environmental management programmes to understand the natural zoonosis of the disease cycle and to limit spread. Active long-term surveillance of animal foci, coupled with a rapid response during animal outbreaks has successfully reduced numbers of human plague outbreaks. In order to effectively and efficiently manage plague outbreaks it is crucial to have an informed and vigilant health care work force (and community) to quickly diagnose and manage patients with infection, to identify risk factors, to conduct ongoing surveillance, to control vectors and hosts, to confirm diagnosis with laboratory tests, and to communicate findings with appropriate authorities.  WHO aims to prevent plague outbreaks by maintaining surveillance and supporting at-risk countries to prepare. As the type of animal reservoir differs according to the region and influences the risk and conditions of human transmission, WHO has developed specific guidelines for the Indian sub-continent, South-America and Sub-Saharan Africa.  WHO works with ministries of health to support countries facing outbreaks for field control activities.", "Where is plague found?": "As an animal disease, plague is found in all continents, except Oceania.

Surveillance and control requires investigating animal and flea species implicated in the plague cycle in the region and developing environmental management programmes to understand the natural zoonosis of the disease cycle and to limit spread. Active long-term surveillance of animal foci, coupled with a rapid response during animal outbreaks has successfully reduced numbers of human plague outbreaks. In order to effectively and efficiently manage plague outbreaks it is crucial to have an informed and vigilant health care work force (and community) to quickly diagnose and manage patients with infection, to identify risk factors, to conduct ongoing surveillance, to control vectors and hosts, to confirm diagnosis with laboratory tests, and to communicate findings with appropriate authorities.

The best practice is to identify Y. pestis from a sample of pus from a bubo, blood or sputum. A specific Y. pestis antigen can be detected by different techniques. One of them is a laboratory validated rapid dipstick test now widely used in Africa and South America, with the support of WHO. Untreated pneumonic plague can be rapidly fatal, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential for survival and reduction of complications. Antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective against plague if patients are diagnosed in time. Pneumonic plague can be fatal within 18 to 24 hours of disease onset if left untreated, but common antibiotics for enterobacteria (gram negative rods) can effectively cure the disease if they are delivered early. Preventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and advising them to take precautions against flea bites and not to handle animal carcasses.

{"title": "Parkinson disease", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a brain condition that causes problems with movement, mental health, sleep, pain and other health issues.  PD gets worse over time. There is no cure, but therapies and medicines can reduce symptoms. Common symptoms include tremors, painful muscle contractions and difficulty speaking. Parkinson disease results in high rates of disability and the need for care. Many people with PD also develop dementia. The disease usually occurs in older people, but younger people can also be affected. Men are affected more often than women.  The cause of PD is unknown but people with a family history of the disease have a higher risk. Exposure to air pollution, pesticides and solvents may increase risk.  Symptoms of Parkinson disease get worse over time. They can greatly reduce well-being and quality of life. PD causes motors symptoms including: Non-motor symptoms: Involuntary movements (dyskinesias) and painful muscle contractions (dystonias) can cause problems speaking and moving. These symptoms lead to high rates of disability and the need for care. Many people with PD also develop dementia during the course of their disease. While PD is the most common movement disorder, other movement disorders exist such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, chorea, ataxia and dystonia. Some movement disorders have similar symptoms to PD such as tremor, slow movement and rigidity. All movement disorders share the same challenges as PD regarding diagnostic and treatment gaps and access to medication, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). PD   is a clinical diagnosis that not only can be made by neurologists but also by trained non-specialist healthcare workers. Assessment and management of PD by trained non-specialized healthcare workers in primary care is particularly important in areas where specialist neurological services are unavailable, such as in some LMIC. The prevalence of PD has doubled in the past 25 years. Global estimates in 2019 showed over 8.5 million individuals with PD. Current estimates suggest that, in 2019, PD resulted in 5.8 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs), an increase of 81% since 2000, and caused 329 000 deaths, an increase of over 100% since 2000. There is no cure for Parkinson disease, but therapies including medicines, surgery and rehabilitation can reduce symptoms.  Levodopa/carbidopa, a combination medicine that increases the amount of dopamine in the brain, is the most common medication for PD  (1) . Doctors may use other medicines such as anticholinergics to reduce involuntary muscle movement.   Deep brain stimulation and other therapies can help the tremors and reduce the need for medicines.  Rehabilitation including physiotherapy can offer relief for Parkinson disease and other degenerative neurologic disorders. Therapies include: These therapies can help improve functioning and quality of life for people with PD. This can also reduce the strain on carers. Many medications and surgical resources are not accessible, available or affordable everywhere, particularly low- and middle-income countries. Informal carers (i.e. most commonly family members and friends) spend   many hours daily   providing care for people living with PD.   This can be overwhelming. Physical, emotional and financial pressures can cause great stress to families and carers, and support is required from the health, social, financial and legal systems. Useful support resources from other conditions can be drawn upon, such as WHO’s  iSupport programme for dementia . People with PD are often subject to stigma and discrimination, including unjust discrimination within the workplace and lack of opportunities to engage and participate in their communities. People with PD require accessible health services for general healthcare needs like the rest of the population, including medicine access, promotive and preventive services and prompt diagnosis, treatment and care.

{"title": "Obesity and overweight", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Overweight is a condition of excessive fat deposits.  Obesity is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a chronic, relapsing disease arising from complex interactions between genetics, neurobiology, eating behaviours, access to healthy diet, market forces, and the broader environment. In the last decades, obesity has expanded globally as countries have experienced greater food security, socioeconomic development, and shifts in diet, physical activity, and societal and individual behavior driven by globalization and industrialized food systems. These forces have created increasingly obesogenic environments, contributing to what is now a global public health crisis with more than 1 billion people living with obesity and prevalence rising in nearly every country  (1) . A diagnosis of overweight or obesity is made by measuring people’s weight and height and by calculating the body mass index (BMI): weight (kg)/height² (m²). The body mass index is a surrogate marker of fatness and additional measurements, such as the waist circumference, can help the diagnosis of obesity. The BMI categories for defining obesity vary by age and gender for adults, adolescents, children and infants. WHO defines overweight and obesity as outlined below. For adults: For children, age needs to be considered when defining overweight and obesity. For children aged 5–19 years: Charts and tables:  WHO growth reference for children aged between 5–19 years For children under 5 years of age: Charts and tables:  WHO child growth standards for children aged under 5 years In 2022, 2.5 billion adults aged 18 years and older were overweight, including over 890 million adults who were living with obesity  (1) . This corresponds to 43% of adults aged 18 years and over (43% of men and 44% of women) who were overweight; this is an increase from 1990, when 25% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight. Prevalence of overweight varied by region, from 31% in the WHO South-East Asia Region and the African Region to 67% in the Region of the Americas. About 16% of adults aged 18 years and older worldwide were obese in 2022. The worldwide prevalence of obesity more than doubled between 1990 and 2022. In 2024, an estimated 35 million children under the age of 5 years were overweight  (2) . Once considered a high-income country problem, overweight is on the rise in low- and middle-income countries. In Africa, the number of overweight children under 5 years has increased by nearly 12.1% since 2000. Almost half of the children under 5 years who were overweight or living with obesity in 2024 lived in Asia. Over 390 million children and adolescents aged 5–19 years were overweight in 2022. The prevalence of overweight (including obesity) among children and adolescents aged 5–19 has risen dramatically from just 8% in 1990 to 20% in 2022. The rise has occurred similarly among both boys and girls: in 2022 19% of girls and 21% of boys were overweight. While just 2% of children and adolescents aged 5–19 were living with obesity in 1990 (31 million young people), by 2022, 8% of children and adolescents were living with obesity (over 160 million young people). Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance of energy intake (diet) and energy expenditure (physical activity). In most cases obesity is a multifactorial disease due to environmental and psycho-social factors and genetic variants. In a subgroup of patients, single major etiological factors can be identified (e.g. medications, diseases, immobilization, iatrogenic procedures, and monogenic disease/genetic syndrome). Key environmental factors affecting the prevalence of overweight and obesity are those that limit the availability of healthy and sustainably-produced food at locally affordable prices spaces for physical activity and the absence of adequate legal and regulatory environments. A further factor is the lack of an effective health system response to identify excess weight gain and fat deposition at an early stage. The health risks caused by overweight and obesity are increasingly well documented and understood. In 2021, higher-than-optimal BMI caused an estimated 3.7 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological disorders, chronic respiratory diseases, and digestive disorders  (3) . Being overweight in childhood and adolescence affects children’s and adolescents’ health and is associated with greater risk and earlier onset of various NCDs, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Childhood and adolescent obesity  have adverse psychosocial consequences; they affects school performance and quality of life, compounded by stigma, discrimination and bullying. Children with obesity are very likely to become adults with obesity and are also at a higher risk of developing NCDs in adulthood. The economic impacts of the obesity epidemic are also important. If nothing is done, the global costs of overweight and obesity are predicted to reach US$ 3 trillion per year by 2030 and more than US$ 18 trillion by 2060  (4) . Finally, the rise in obesity rates in low-and middle-income countries, including among lower socio-economic groups, is fast globalizing a problem that was once associated only with high-income countries. Many low- and middle-income countries face a so-called double burden of malnutrition. While these countries continue to deal with the problems of infectious diseases and undernutrition, they are also experiencing a rapid upsurge in noncommunicable disease risk factors such as obesity and overweight. It is common to find undernutrition and obesity co-existing within the same country, the same community and the same household. Children in low- and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to inadequate pre-natal, infant, and young child nutrition. At the same time, these children are exposed to high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense, and micronutrient-poor foods, which tend to be lower in cost but also lower in nutrient quality. These dietary patterns, in conjunction with lower levels of physical activity, result in sharp increases in childhood obesity while undernutrition issues remain unsolved. Overweight and obesity, as well as their related noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable and manageable.

World Obesity Federation, 2022.", "Overview": "Overweight is a condition of excessive fat deposits.  Obesity is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a chronic, relapsing disease arising from complex interactions between genetics, neurobiology, eating behaviours, access to healthy diet, market forces, and the broader environment. In the last decades, obesity has expanded globally as countries have experienced greater food security, socioeconomic development, and shifts in diet, physical activity, and societal and individual behavior driven by globalization and industrialized food systems. These forces have created increasingly obesogenic environments, contributing to what is now a global public health crisis with more than 1 billion people living with obesity and prevalence rising in nearly every country  (1) . A diagnosis of overweight or obesity is made by measuring people’s weight and height and by calculating the body mass index (BMI): weight (kg)/height² (m²). The body mass index is a surrogate marker of fatness and additional measurements, such as the waist circumference, can help the diagnosis of obesity. The BMI categories for defining obesity vary by age and gender for adults, adolescents, children and infants. WHO defines overweight and obesity as outlined below. For adults: For children, age needs to be considered when defining overweight and obesity. For children aged 5–19 years: Charts and tables:  WHO growth reference for children aged between 5–19 years For children under 5 years of age: Charts and tables:  WHO child growth standards for children aged under 5 years In 2022, 2.5 billion adults aged 18 years and older were overweight, including over 890 million adults who were living with obesity  (1) . This corresponds to 43% of adults aged 18 years and over (43% of men and 44% of women) who were overweight; this is an increase from 1990, when 25% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight. Prevalence of overweight varied by region, from 31% in the WHO South-East Asia Region and the African Region to 67% in the Region of the Americas. About 16% of adults aged 18 years and older worldwide were obese in 2022. The worldwide prevalence of obesity more than doubled between 1990 and 2022. In 2024, an estimated 35 million children under the age of 5 years were overweight  (2) . Once considered a high-income country problem, overweight is on the rise in low- and middle-income countries. In Africa, the number of overweight children under 5 years has increased by nearly 12.1% since 2000. Almost half of the children under 5 years who were overweight or living with obesity in 2024 lived in Asia. Over 390 million children and adolescents aged 5–19 years were overweight in 2022. The prevalence of overweight (including obesity) among children and adolescents aged 5–19 has risen dramatically from just 8% in 1990 to 20% in 2022. The rise has occurred similarly among both boys and girls: in 2022 19% of girls and 21% of boys were overweight. While just 2% of children and adolescents aged 5–19 were living with obesity in 1990 (31 million young people), by 2022, 8% of children and adolescents were living with obesity (over 160 million young people). Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance of energy intake (diet) and energy expenditure (physical activity). In most cases obesity is a multifactorial disease due to environmental and psycho-social factors and genetic variants. In a subgroup of patients, single major etiological factors can be identified (e.g. medications, diseases, immobilization, iatrogenic procedures, and monogenic disease/genetic syndrome). Key environmental factors affecting the prevalence of overweight and obesity are those that limit the availability of healthy and sustainably-produced food at locally affordable prices spaces for physical activity and the absence of adequate legal and regulatory environments. A further factor is the lack of an effective health system response to identify excess weight gain and fat deposition at an early stage. The health risks caused by overweight and obesity are increasingly well documented and understood. In 2021, higher-than-optimal BMI caused an estimated 3.7 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological disorders, chronic respiratory diseases, and digestive disorders  (3) . Being overweight in childhood and adolescence affects children’s and adolescents’ health and is associated with greater risk and earlier onset of various NCDs, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Childhood and adolescent obesity  have adverse psychosocial consequences; they affects school performance and quality of life, compounded by stigma, discrimination and bullying. Children with obesity are very likely to become adults with obesity and are also at a higher risk of developing NCDs in adulthood. The economic impacts of the obesity epidemic are also important. If nothing is done, the global costs of overweight and obesity are predicted to reach US$ 3 trillion per year by 2030 and more than US$ 18 trillion by 2060  (4) . Finally, the rise in obesity rates in low-and middle-income countries, including among lower socio-economic groups, is fast globalizing a problem that was once associated only with high-income countries. Many low- and middle-income countries face a so-called double burden of malnutrition. While these countries continue to deal with the problems of infectious diseases and undernutrition, they are also experiencing a rapid upsurge in noncommunicable disease risk factors such as obesity and overweight. It is common to find undernutrition and obesity co-existing within the same country, the same community and the same household. Children in low- and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to inadequate pre-natal, infant, and young child nutrition. At the same time, these children are exposed to high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense, and micronutrient-poor foods, which tend to be lower in cost but also lower in nutrient quality. These dietary patterns, in conjunction with lower levels of physical activity, result in sharp increases in childhood obesity while undernutrition issues remain unsolved. Overweight and obesity, as well as their related noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable and manageable. At the individual level, people may be able to reduce their risk by adopting preventive interventions at each step of the life cycle, starting from pre-conception and continuing during the early years. These include: Health practitioners need to: Dietary and physical activity patterns are largely the result of environmental and societal conditions that greatly constrain personal choice. Obesity is a societal rather than an individual responsibility, with the solutions to be found through the creation of supportive environments and communities that embed healthy diets and regular physical activity as the most accessible, available and affordable behaviours of daily life.

World Obesity Federation, 2022.", "Common health consequences": "The health risks caused by overweight and obesity are increasingly well documented and understood. In 2021, higher-than-optimal BMI caused an estimated 3.7 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological disorders, chronic respiratory diseases, and digestive disorders  (3) . Being overweight in childhood and adolescence affects children’s and adolescents’ health and is associated with greater risk and earlier onset of various NCDs, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Childhood and adolescent obesity  have adverse psychosocial consequences; they affects school performance and quality of life, compounded by stigma, discrimination and bullying. Children with obesity are very likely to become adults with obesity and are also at a higher risk of developing NCDs in adulthood. The economic impacts of the obesity epidemic are also important. If nothing is done, the global costs of overweight and obesity are predicted to reach US$ 3 trillion per year by 2030 and more than US$ 18 trillion by 2060  (4) . Finally, the rise in obesity rates in low-and middle-income countries, including among lower socio-economic groups, is fast globalizing a problem that was once associated only with high-income countries. Many low- and middle-income countries face a so-called double burden of malnutrition. While these countries continue to deal with the problems of infectious diseases and undernutrition, they are also experiencing a rapid upsurge in noncommunicable disease risk factors such as obesity and overweight. It is common to find undernutrition and obesity co-existing within the same country, the same community and the same household. Children in low- and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to inadequate pre-natal, infant, and young child nutrition. At the same time, these children are exposed to high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense, and micronutrient-poor foods, which tend to be lower in cost but also lower in nutrient quality. These dietary patterns, in conjunction with lower levels of physical activity, result in sharp increases in childhood obesity while undernutrition issues remain unsolved. Overweight and obesity, as well as their related noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable and manageable. At the individual level, people may be able to reduce their risk by adopting preventive interventions at each step of the life cycle, starting from pre-conception and continuing during the early years. These include: Health practitioners need to: Dietary and physical activity patterns are largely the result of environmental and societal conditions that greatly constrain personal choice. Obesity is a societal rather than an individual responsibility, with the solutions to be found through the creation of supportive environments and communities that embed healthy diets and regular physical activity as the most accessible, available and affordable behaviours of daily life. Stopping the rise in obesity demands multisectoral actions in areas such as food manufacturing, marketing and pricing and others that seek to address the wider determinants of health (such as poverty reduction and urban planning).

{"title": "Noncommunicable diseases", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, tend to be of long duration and are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types of NCDs are cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes. NCDs disproportionately affect people in low- and middle-income countries, where nearly three quarters of global NCD deaths (32 million) occur. People of all age groups, regions and countries are affected by NCDs. These conditions are often associated with older age groups, but about 18 million NCD deaths occur before the age of 70 years. NCDs cause more deaths in this age group than all other causes of death combined. Of these premature deaths, 82% are estimated to occur in low- and middle-income countries. Children, adults and the elderly are all vulnerable to the risk factors contributing to NCDs, whether from unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, exposure to tobacco smoke, or the harmful use of alcohol or air pollution. Unhealthy diets and a lack of physical activity may show up in people as raised blood pressure, increased blood glucose, elevated blood lipids and obesity. These are called metabolic risk factors and can lead to cardiovascular disease, the leading NCD in terms of premature deaths. Behavioural risk factors increase the risk of NCDS, including: The social, commercial, and physical environment are key drivers of these behaviours. Behavioural risk factors contribute to four key metabolic changes that increase the risk of NCDs: In terms of attributable deaths, the leading metabolic risk factor globally is elevated blood pressure (to which 25% of global NCD deaths are attributed)  (1),  followed by raised blood glucose and overweight and obesity. Several environmental risk factors contribute to NCDs. Air pollution – indoor and outdoor – is the largest of these, accounting for 6.7 million deaths globally, of which about 5.6 million are due to NCDs, including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. NCDs threaten progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a target of reducing the probability of death from any of the four main NCDs between ages 30 and 70 years by one third by 2030. Poverty is closely linked with NCDs. The rapid rise in NCDs is predicted to impede poverty reduction initiatives in low-income countries, particularly by increasing household costs associated with health care. Vulnerable and socially disadvantaged people get sicker and die sooner than people of higher socio-economic positions, especially because they may have limited access to health services. To reduce these inequities, governments must invest in health systems that respond to users’ expectations and needs. An important way to control NCDs is to focus on reducing the risk factors associated with these diseases. Low-cost solutions exist for governments and other stakeholders to reduce the common modifiable risk factors. Monitoring progress and trends of NCDs and their risk is important for guiding policy and priorities. To lessen the impact of NCDs on individuals and society, a comprehensive approach is needed requiring all sectors, including health, finance, transport, education, agriculture, planning and others, to collaborate to reduce the risks associated with NCDs, and to promote interventions to prevent and control them. Investing in better management of NCDs is critical. Management of NCDs includes detecting, screening and treating these diseases, and providing access to palliative care for people in need. High impact essential NCD interventions can be delivered through a primary health care approach to strengthen early detection and timely treatment. Evidence shows such interventions are excellent economic investments because, if provided early to patients, they can reduce the need for more expensive treatment. Countries with inadequate health care coverage are unlikely to provide universal access to essential NCD interventions. NCD management interventions are essential for achieving the SDG target on NCDs. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes NCDs as a major challenge for sustainable development. As part of the Agenda, heads of state and government committed to develop ambitious national responses, by 2030, to reduce by one third premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment (SDG target 3.4). WHO plays a key leadership role in the coordination and promotion of the global fight against NCDs and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals target 3.4. In 2019, the World Health Assembly extended the WHO Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013–2020 to 2030 and called for the development of an Implementation Roadmap 2023 to 2030 to accelerate progress on preventing and controlling NCDs. The Roadmap supports actions to achieve a set of nine global targets with the greatest impact towards prevention and management of NCDs.    (1)  Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) Results (2024, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation – IHME) https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/", "People at risk": "People of all age groups, regions and countries are affected by NCDs.

Low-cost solutions exist for governments and other stakeholders to reduce the common modifiable risk factors. Monitoring progress and trends of NCDs and their risk is important for guiding policy and priorities. To lessen the impact of NCDs on individuals and society, a comprehensive approach is needed requiring all sectors, including health, finance, transport, education, agriculture, planning and others, to collaborate to reduce the risks associated with NCDs, and to promote interventions to prevent and control them. Investing in better management of NCDs is critical. Management of NCDs includes detecting, screening and treating these diseases, and providing access to palliative care for people in need. High impact essential NCD interventions can be delivered through a primary health care approach to strengthen early detection and timely treatment. Evidence shows such interventions are excellent economic investments because, if provided early to patients, they can reduce the need for more expensive treatment. Countries with inadequate health care coverage are unlikely to provide universal access to essential NCD interventions. NCD management interventions are essential for achieving the SDG target on NCDs. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes NCDs as a major challenge for sustainable development. As part of the Agenda, heads of state and government committed to develop ambitious national responses, by 2030, to reduce by one third premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment (SDG target 3.4).

{"title": "Nipah virus", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus, usually transmitted from animals to humans, but can also be transmitted through contaminated food or directly between people. Nipah virus was first identified in 1998 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia. In 1999, an outbreak was reported in Singapore following the importation of sick pigs from Malaysia. No new outbreaks have been reported from Malaysia or Singapore since 1999. In 2001, Nipah virus infection outbreaks were detected in India and Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, outbreaks have been reported almost every year since. In India, outbreaks are periodically reported in several parts of the country, including the latest one in 2026. In 2014, an outbreak was reported in the Philippines with no new cases since then.  Fruit bats from the  Pteropodidae  family are considered the natural host of Nipah virus and are present in different parts of Asia and in Australia. African fruit bats of the genus  Eidolon , family  Pteropodidae,  have been found to have antibodies against Nipah and Hendra viruses, indicating that these viruses might also be present within the geographic distribution of  Pteropodidae  bats in Africa. Infection with Nipah virus does not appear to cause disease in fruit bats. Transmission of the virus to humans can occur from direct contact with infected animals like bats, pigs or horses, and by consuming fruits or fruit products, such as raw date palm juice, contaminated by infected fruit bats. The virus can also cause severe disease in farming animals such as pigs.   Nipah virus can also spread between people. It has been reported in health-care settings and among family and caregivers of sick people through close contact. In health facilities, the risk of spread can increase in overcrowded, poorly ventilated hospital environments with inadequate implementation of infection prevention and control measures (such as the use of personal protective equipment, cleaning and disinfection, and hand hygiene). The incubation period – that is the time from infection to the onset of symptoms – ranges from 3 to 14 days. In some rare cases incubation of up to 45 days has been reported. For some people, Nipah virus infection may be asymptomatic. However, most people develop a fever, and symptoms involving the brain (such as headache or confusion), and/or the lungs (such as difficulty breathing or cough). Other organs can also be affected. Frequent other symptoms include chills, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhoea. Severe disease can occur in any patient but is particularly associated with people presenting with neurological symptoms, with progression to brain swelling (encephalitis) and, frequently, death. Careful supportive care and monitoring during this period is critical. Most people who survive make a full recovery, but long-term neurologic conditions have been reported in approximately 1 in 5 people who recovered from the disease. It is difficult to distinguish Nipah from other infectious diseases, or other causes of encephalitis or pneumonia, without laboratory testing. The main diagnostic test is real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of respiratory samples, blood or cerebrospinal fluid (a spinal tap). Blood antibody detection via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) may also be used.  Samples collected from patients are a biohazard risk. Laboratory testing on non-inactivated samples should be conducted under maximum biological containment conditions.   Samples taken from people and animals with suspected Nipah virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories. While there are no specific treatments for Nipah, early diagnosis will promote early supportive care. For all severe viral infections, high-quality supportive medical care can prevent deaths, and includes:  There are currently no approved drugs or vaccines for Nipah virus infection. WHO has identified Nipah virus infection as a priority disease for the  WHO Research and Development Blueprint . A range of candidate products are under different stages of development.   Raising awareness of the risk factors for infection and on measures people can take to protect themselves and prevent transmission is critical. WHO recommends taking measures as noted below. Efforts to prevent transmission should first focus on decreasing bat access to date palm sap and other fresh food products. Keeping bats away from sap collection sites by using protective coverings may be helpful. Freshly collected date palm juice should be boiled, and fruits should be thoroughly washed and peeled before consumption. Fruits with any sign of bat bites should be discarded. Gloves and other protective clothing should be worn while handling sick animals such as pigs or horses, and during slaughtering and culling procedures. In areas where the virus is present, when establishing new pig farms, considerations should be given to the presence of fruit bats in the area and in general, pig feed and pig sheds should be protected against bats when feasible. In past outbreaks of Nipah involving pig farms, several measures were implemented to reduce transmission including: routine and thorough cleaning and disinfection of farms;  quarantining animal premises in the case of suspected cases; culling of infected animals, with close supervision of burial or incineration of carcasses; and restricting or banning the movement of animals from infected farms to other areas. For more information, see the  World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH)  webpage on Nipah virus infection. People experiencing Nipah-like symptoms should be referred to a health facility, as early supportive care is key in the absence of licensed treatment. Close unprotected physical contact with sick people should be avoided. Regular hand washing should be carried out after caring for or visiting sick people along other preventive measures.  WHO advises health-care workers to implement standard precautions for infection prevention and control at all times, for all patients:  WHO continues to monitor any upcoming new evidence to ensure recommendations remain up-to-date. WHO works closely with at-risk countries and partners to strengthen preparedness for and response to outbreaks of Nipah virus infection by providing technical guidance and supporting surveillance activities, clinical management, laboratory services, infection prevention and control measures, logistics, training and community engagement.

{"title": "Mpox", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Mpox is an infectious disease that can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, headache, muscle ache, back pain and low energy. Most people fully recover, but some get very sick.  Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). It is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus of the  Orthopoxvirus  genus in the  Poxviridae  family, which includes variola, cowpox, vaccinia and other viruses. There are two distinct clades of the virus: clade I (with subclades Ia and Ib) and clade II (with subclades IIa and IIb). A global outbreak of clade IIb began in 2022 and continues to this day, including in some African countries. There are also growing outbreaks of clades Ia and Ib affecting the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries in Africa. As of August 2024, clade Ib has also been detected beyond Africa. The natural reservoir of the virus is unknown, but various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys are susceptible.  Mpox spreads from person to person mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox, including members of a household. Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and it can also include being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). People with multiple sexual partners are at higher risk of acquiring mpox.  People can also contract mpox from contaminated objects such as clothing or linen, through needle injuries in health care, or in community settings such as tattoo parlours.  During pregnancy or birth, the virus may be passed to the baby. Contracting mpox during pregnancy can be dangerous for the fetus or newborn infant and can lead to loss of the pregnancy, stillbirth, death of the newborn, or complications for the parent.   Animal-to-human transmission of mpox occurs from infected animals to humans from bites or scratches, or during activities such as hunting, skinning, trapping, cooking, playing with carcasses or eating animals .  The animal reservoir of the monkeypox virus remains unknown and further studies are underway.  More research is needed on how mpox spreads during outbreaks in different settings and under different conditions. Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week but can start 1–21 days after exposure. Symptoms typically last 2–4 weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system.  Common symptoms of mpox are:  For some people, the first symptom of mpox is a rash, while others may have fever, muscle aches or sore throat first.   The mpox rash often begins on the face and spreads over the body, extending to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It can also start on other parts of the body where contact was made, such as the genitals. It starts as a flat sore, which develops into a blister filled with liquid that may be itchy or painful. As the rash heals, the lesions dry up, crust over and fall off.  Some people may have one or a few skin lesions and others have hundreds or more. These can appear anywhere on the body including:  Some people also have painful swelling of their rectum (proctitis) or pain and difficulty when peeing (dysuria) or when swallowing.  People with mpox can pass the disease on to others until all sores have healed and a new layer of skin has formed. Some people can be infected without developing any symptoms. Although getting mpox from someone who is asymptomatic (not showing symptoms) has been reported, information is still limited on how common it is.    Children, pregnant people and people with weak immune systems, including people living with HIV that is not well controlled, are at higher risk for serious illness and death due to complications from mpox.  Some people with mpox become very sick. For example, the skin can become infected with bacteria, leading to abscesses or serious skin damage. Other complications include pneumonia; corneal infection with loss of vision; pain or difficulty swallowing; vomiting and diarrhoea causing dehydration or malnutrition; and infections of the blood (sepsis), brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis), rectum (proctitis), genital organs (balanitis) or urinary passages (urethritis). Mpox can be fatal in some cases.   Identifying mpox can be difficult because other infections and conditions can look similar. It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmitted infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also have another sexually transmitted infection at the same time, such as syphilis or herpes. Alternatively, a child with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox. For these reasons, testing is key for people to get care as early as possible and prevent severe illness and further spread. The preferred laboratory test for mpox is detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash – skin, fluid or crusts – collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done using swabs of the throat or anus. Testing blood is not recommended. Antibody detection methods may not be useful as they do not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses.  HIV testing should be offered to adults with mpox, and children as appropriate. Diagnostic tests for other conditions should be considered where feasible, for example, varicella zoster virus (VZV), syphilis and herpes. The goal of treating mpox is to take care of the rash, manage pain and prevent complications. Early and supportive care is important to help manage symptoms and avoid further problems.  Getting an mpox vaccine can help prevent infection (pre-exposure prophylaxis). It is recommended for people at high-risk of getting mpox, especially during an outbreak.  Groups that may be at high risk of mpox include:  The vaccine can also be administered after a person has been in contact with someone who has mpox (post-exposure prophylaxis). In these cases, the vaccine should be given less than 4 days after contact with someone who has mpox. The vaccine can be given for up to 14 days if the person has not developed symptoms. Some antivirals have received emergency use authorization in some countries and are being evaluated in clinical trials. To date, there is no proven effective antiviral treatment for mpox. It is a priority to continue evaluation of therapeutics in robust clinical trials and to focus on optimizing supportive care for patients. Individuals with HIV and mpox should continue taking their antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART should be initiated within 7 days of diagnosis of HIV. Most people with mpox will recover within 2–4 weeks. Things to do to help the symptoms and prevent transmitting mpox to others:  Do  Do not  To prevent spread of mpox to others, people with mpox should isolate at home following guidance from their health care provider, or in hospital if needed, for the duration of the infectious period (from onset of symptoms until lesions have healed and scabs fall off). Covering lesions and wearing a well-fitting mask when in the presence of others may help prevent spread. Using condoms during sex will help reduce the risk of getting mpox but will not prevent spread from skin-to-skin or mouth-to-skin contact. If having sex, use condoms as a precaution for 12 weeks (about 3 months) after you have recovered. Taking a break from sexual activity with new partners during periods of increased transmission can reduce the risk of getting mpox. Those who have had contact with someone with mpox should monitor for signs and symptoms for 21 days (3 weeks) and take precautions such as avoiding sexual activity during this period. Health workers should follow infection prevention and control measures to protect themselves while caring for patients with mpox by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (i.e. gloves, gown, eye protection and respirator) and adhering to protocol for safely swabbing lesions for diagnostic testing and handling sharp objects such as needles. The monkeypox virus was discovered in Denmark (1958) in monkeys kept for research. The first reported human case of mpox was a nine-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1970). Following the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the end of smallpox vaccination worldwide, mpox steadily emerged in central, east and west Africa. Since then, mpox has been reported sporadically in central and east Africa (clade I) and west Africa (clade II). In 2003, an outbreak in the United States of America was linked to imported wild animals (clade II). Since 2005, thousands of cases are reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo every year. In 2017, mpox re-emerged in Nigeria and continues to spread between people across the country and in travellers to other destinations.  Data on suspected and confirmed cases reported up to 2021 are available  here  and data on laboratory confirmed cases from 2022 until today are available  here . In May 2022, an outbreak of mpox appeared suddenly and rapidly spread across Europe, the Americas and then all six WHO regions. The global outbreak has affected primarily (but not only) gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and has spread person-to-person through sexual networks. More information on the global outbreak is available  here , including information on  community responses  to control the outbreak. In 2022, outbreaks of mpox due to clade I occurred in refugee camps in the Republic of the Sudan.  Since 2022, there has also been an upsurge in mpox cases and deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In some areas of the country, a new offshoot of clade I, called clade Ib, has been spreading person-to-person. As of mid-2024, the clade has also been reported in other countries.  Over 120 countries have reported mpox between Jan 2022 – Aug 2024, with over 100 000 laboratory-confirmed cases reported and over 220 deaths among confirmed cases. Stigma and discrimination for any disease are never acceptable. Stigma linked to mpox can undermine public health efforts or prolong a disease outbreak, as people may be more reluctant to come forward and seek care and treatment. For mpox, stigma, discrimination and racism have been particularly directed against communities initially most affected by the disease, namely men who have sex with men, trans people and gender diverse communities. WHO works with Member States and partners to prevent and respond to outbreaks of mpox. This includes coordinating research on vaccines and treatments, strengthening country health systems, and working to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) twice, the first time in May 2022 and the second time in August 2024.", "Overview": "Mpox is an infectious disease that can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, headache, muscle ache, back pain and low energy.

Symptoms typically last 2–4 weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system.  Common symptoms of mpox are:  For some people, the first symptom of mpox is a rash, while others may have fever, muscle aches or sore throat first.   The mpox rash often begins on the face and spreads over the body, extending to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It can also start on other parts of the body where contact was made, such as the genitals. It starts as a flat sore, which develops into a blister filled with liquid that may be itchy or painful. As the rash heals, the lesions dry up, crust over and fall off.  Some people may have one or a few skin lesions and others have hundreds or more. These can appear anywhere on the body including:  Some people also have painful swelling of their rectum (proctitis) or pain and difficulty when peeing (dysuria) or when swallowing.  People with mpox can pass the disease on to others until all sores have healed and a new layer of skin has formed. Some people can be infected without developing any symptoms. Although getting mpox from someone who is asymptomatic (not showing symptoms) has been reported, information is still limited on how common it is.    Children, pregnant people and people with weak immune systems, including people living with HIV that is not well controlled, are at higher risk for serious illness and death due to complications from mpox.  Some people with mpox become very sick. For example, the skin can become infected with bacteria, leading to abscesses or serious skin damage. Other complications include pneumonia; corneal infection with loss of vision; pain or difficulty swallowing; vomiting and diarrhoea causing dehydration or malnutrition; and infections of the blood (sepsis), brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis), rectum (proctitis), genital organs (balanitis) or urinary passages (urethritis). Mpox can be fatal in some cases.   Identifying mpox can be difficult because other infections and conditions can look similar. It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmitted infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also have another sexually transmitted infection at the same time, such as syphilis or herpes. Alternatively, a child with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox. For these reasons, testing is key for people to get care as early as possible and prevent severe illness and further spread. The preferred laboratory test for mpox is detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash – skin, fluid or crusts – collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done using swabs of the throat or anus. Testing blood is not recommended. Antibody detection methods may not be useful as they do not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses.  HIV testing should be offered to adults with mpox, and children as appropriate. Diagnostic tests for other conditions should be considered where feasible, for example, varicella zoster virus (VZV), syphilis and herpes. The goal of treating mpox is to take care of the rash, manage pain and prevent complications. Early and supportive care is important to help manage symptoms and avoid further problems.  Getting an mpox vaccine can help prevent infection (pre-exposure prophylaxis). It is recommended for people at high-risk of getting mpox, especially during an outbreak.  Groups that may be at high risk of mpox include:  The vaccine can also be administered after a person has been in contact with someone who has mpox (post-exposure prophylaxis). In these cases, the vaccine should be given less than 4 days after contact with someone who has mpox. The vaccine can be given for up to 14 days if the person has not developed symptoms. Some antivirals have received emergency use authorization in some countries and are being evaluated in clinical trials. To date, there is no proven effective antiviral treatment for mpox. It is a priority to continue evaluation of therapeutics in robust clinical trials and to focus on optimizing supportive care for patients. Individuals with HIV and mpox should continue taking their antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART should be initiated within 7 days of diagnosis of HIV. Most people with mpox will recover within 2–4 weeks. Things to do to help the symptoms and prevent transmitting mpox to others:  Do  Do not  To prevent spread of mpox to others, people with mpox should isolate at home following guidance from their health care provider, or in hospital if needed, for the duration of the infectious period (from onset of symptoms until lesions have healed and scabs fall off). Covering lesions and wearing a well-fitting mask when in the presence of others may help prevent spread. Using condoms during sex will help reduce the risk of getting mpox but will not prevent spread from skin-to-skin or mouth-to-skin contact. If having sex, use condoms as a precaution for 12 weeks (about 3 months) after you have recovered. Taking a break from sexual activity with new partners during periods of increased transmission can reduce the risk of getting mpox. Those who have had contact with someone with mpox should monitor for signs and symptoms for 21 days (3 weeks) and take precautions such as avoiding sexual activity during this period. Health workers should follow infection prevention and control measures to protect themselves while caring for patients with mpox by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (i.e. gloves, gown, eye protection and respirator) and adhering to protocol for safely swabbing lesions for diagnostic testing and handling sharp objects such as needles. The monkeypox virus was discovered in Denmark (1958) in monkeys kept for research. The first reported human case of mpox was a nine-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1970). Following the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the end of smallpox vaccination worldwide, mpox steadily emerged in central, east and west Africa. Since then, mpox has been reported sporadically in central and east Africa (clade I) and west Africa (clade II). In 2003, an outbreak in the United States of America was linked to imported wild animals (clade II). Since 2005, thousands of cases are reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo every year. In 2017, mpox re-emerged in Nigeria and continues to spread between people across the country and in travellers to other destinations.  Data on suspected and confirmed cases reported up to 2021 are available  here  and data on laboratory confirmed cases from 2022 until today are available  here . In May 2022, an outbreak of mpox appeared suddenly and rapidly spread across Europe, the Americas and then all six WHO regions. The global outbreak has affected primarily (but not only) gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and has spread person-to-person through sexual networks. More information on the global outbreak is available  here , including information on  community responses  to control the outbreak. In 2022, outbreaks of mpox due to clade I occurred in refugee camps in the Republic of the Sudan.  Since 2022, there has also been an upsurge in mpox cases and deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In some areas of the country, a new offshoot of clade I, called clade Ib, has been spreading person-to-person. As of mid-2024, the clade has also been reported in other countries.  Over 120 countries have reported mpox between Jan 2022 – Aug 2024, with over 100 000 laboratory-confirmed cases reported and over 220 deaths among confirmed cases. Stigma and discrimination for any disease are never acceptable. Stigma linked to mpox can undermine public health efforts or prolong a disease outbreak, as people may be more reluctant to come forward and seek care and treatment. For mpox, stigma, discrimination and racism have been particularly directed against communities initially most affected by the disease, namely men who have sex with men, trans people and gender diverse communities. WHO works with Member States and partners to prevent and respond to outbreaks of mpox. This includes coordinating research on vaccines and treatments, strengthening country health systems, and working to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) twice, the first time in May 2022 and the second time in August 2024.", "Transmission": "Mpox spreads from person to person mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox, including members of a household. Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and it can also include being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles).

Things to do to help the symptoms and prevent transmitting mpox to others:  Do  Do not  To prevent spread of mpox to others, people with mpox should isolate at home following guidance from their health care provider, or in hospital if needed, for the duration of the infectious period (from onset of symptoms until lesions have healed and scabs fall off). Covering lesions and wearing a well-fitting mask when in the presence of others may help prevent spread. Using condoms during sex will help reduce the risk of getting mpox but will not prevent spread from skin-to-skin or mouth-to-skin contact. If having sex, use condoms as a precaution for 12 weeks (about 3 months) after you have recovered. Taking a break from sexual activity with new partners during periods of increased transmission can reduce the risk of getting mpox. Those who have had contact with someone with mpox should monitor for signs and symptoms for 21 days (3 weeks) and take precautions such as avoiding sexual activity during this period. Health workers should follow infection prevention and control measures to protect themselves while caring for patients with mpox by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (i.e. gloves, gown, eye protection and respirator) and adhering to protocol for safely swabbing lesions for diagnostic testing and handling sharp objects such as needles. The monkeypox virus was discovered in Denmark (1958) in monkeys kept for research. The first reported human case of mpox was a nine-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1970). Following the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the end of smallpox vaccination worldwide, mpox steadily emerged in central, east and west Africa. Since then, mpox has been reported sporadically in central and east Africa (clade I) and west Africa (clade II). In 2003, an outbreak in the United States of America was linked to imported wild animals (clade II). Since 2005, thousands of cases are reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo every year. In 2017, mpox re-emerged in Nigeria and continues to spread between people across the country and in travellers to other destinations.  Data on suspected and confirmed cases reported up to 2021 are available  here  and data on laboratory confirmed cases from 2022 until today are available  here . In May 2022, an outbreak of mpox appeared suddenly and rapidly spread across Europe, the Americas and then all six WHO regions. The global outbreak has affected primarily (but not only) gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and has spread person-to-person through sexual networks. More information on the global outbreak is available  here , including information on  community responses  to control the outbreak. In 2022, outbreaks of mpox due to clade I occurred in refugee camps in the Republic of the Sudan.  Since 2022, there has also been an upsurge in mpox cases and deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In some areas of the country, a new offshoot of clade I, called clade Ib, has been spreading person-to-person. As of mid-2024, the clade has also been reported in other countries.  Over 120 countries have reported mpox between Jan 2022 – Aug 2024, with over 100 000 laboratory-confirmed cases reported and over 220 deaths among confirmed cases. Stigma and discrimination for any disease are never acceptable. Stigma linked to mpox can undermine public health efforts or prolong a disease outbreak, as people may be more reluctant to come forward and seek care and treatment. For mpox, stigma, discrimination and racism have been particularly directed against communities initially most affected by the disease, namely men who have sex with men, trans people and gender diverse communities. WHO works with Member States and partners to prevent and respond to outbreaks of mpox. This includes coordinating research on vaccines and treatments, strengthening country health systems, and working to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools.

{"title": "Migraine and other headache disorders", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Headache disorders, characterized by recurrent headaches, are among the most common disorders of the nervous system. A headache is a painful and disabling feature of primary headache disorders, namely migraine, tension-type headache and cluster headache. Headaches can also be caused by or occur secondarily to a long list of other conditions, the most common of which is medication-overuse headache. Headaches, particularly migraine, can also affect children and adolescents but can affect them in different ways. Headache disorders can result in missing school, sports and other activities in children, adolescents and adults. Globally, headache disorders affect approximately 40% of the population, or 3.1 billion people in 2021, and are more common in females compared to males. They are among the top three most common neurological conditions for most age groups, starting with age 5 and remaining in the top three until the age of 80. Despite some regional variations, headache disorders are a worldwide problem, affecting people of all races, income levels and geographical areas  (1) .  Not only is a headache painful, but it is also disabling. According to the Global Health Estimates 2021, migraine headaches was found to be third highest cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide, after stroke and neonatal encephalopathy. Headache disorders impose a burden on individuals that can include substantial personal suffering, impaired quality of life and financial cost. Repeated headache attacks, and often the constant fear of the next one, damage family life, social life and employment. The long-term effort of coping with a chronic headache disorder may also predispose the individual to other illnesses. For example, anxiety and depression are significantly more common in people who experience migraines than in healthy individuals.  Migraines, tension-type headaches, cluster headaches and medication-overuse headaches are of public health importance since they are responsible for high population levels of disability and ill health. Migraine is characterized by recurring attacks and is often life-long. It is a primary headache disorder, that is in most cases episodic,  usually lasts 4–72 hours, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting and/or photophobia and phonophobia. It is sometimes preceded by an aura of reversable, visual, sensory or other symptoms. Migraine most often begins at puberty and generally affects those aged between 35 and 45 years. It is more common in women, possibly because of hormonal influences. Children typically experience migraine of shorter duration and abdominal symptoms are usually more prominent. The exact cause of migraine is currently unknown but it is thought to result from the release of pain producing inflammatory substances around the nerves and blood vessels of the head. It can be triggered by alcohol, sleep disruption and certain foods. Attacks typically include headache, which is often: Tension-type headaches (TTH) are described as pressure or tightness, often like a band around the head, sometimes spreading into or from the neck. They may be stress-related or associated with musculoskeletal problems in the neck. They often begin during the teenage years and affect 50% more woman than men. Episodic TTH, occurring on fewer than 15 days per month, is reported by more than 70% of some populations. Episodic TTH attacks usually last a few hours but can persist for several days.  Chronic TTH can be unremitting and is more disabling than episodic TTH.  Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache disorder characterized by frequently recurring (up to several times a day), brief but extremely severe headache, usually focused in or around one eye, with tearing and redness of the eye. The nose often runs or is blocked on the affected side and the eyelid may droop. CH is relatively uncommon affecting fewer than 1 in 1000 adults, affecting six men to each woman. Most people developing CH are in their 20s or older. CH has episodic and chronic forms. Medication-overuse headaches (MOH) are caused by chronic and excessive use of medication to treat headache. MOH is the most common secondary headache disorder. It may affect up to 5% of some populations, women more than men. MOH occurs by definition on more days than not, is oppressive, persistent and often at its worst on awakening.  Migraines and other headaches can affect people's ability to work, through decreased productivity, and interpersonal relationships. Often people continue to try to work despite the debilitating symptoms that can occur. Headache-related productivity loss may affect people's careers and/or security, financial situation, relationships, and mental health. It also causes economic loss to companies and society. Many of those troubled by headaches do not receive effective diagnosis and care. Appropriate treatment of headache disorders requires training of health professionals, accurate diagnosis and recognition of the conditions, appropriate treatment with cost-effective medications, simple lifestyle modifications and patient education. The main classes of drugs to treat headache disorders include analgesics, anti-emetics, specific anti-migraine medications and prophylactic medications. For migraine treatment, analgesics need to be taken at the first sign of symptoms (such as visual aura) to prevent the associated headache. Simple interventions to educate people on medication overuse headaches, migraine triggers and lifestyle modifications are highly effective. Restricting or eliminating  alcohol , regular sleep and exercise schedules,  healthy diets , staying hydrated and using a headache calendar to identify other triggers are often all that is needed to provide relief.  Lack of knowledge among health care providers is the principal clinical barrier. Many people with headache disorders are not diagnosed and treated. In many countries medications, such as sumatriptan for migraines, are not available. Poor awareness extends to the general public. Headache disorders are not perceived by the public as serious since they are mostly episodic, do not cause death and are not contagious. The low consultation rates in developed countries may indicate that many affected people are unaware that effective treatments exist. Half of people with headache disorders are estimated to be self-treating.  Many governments, seeking to constrain health care costs, do not acknowledge the substantial burden of headache on society. They might not recognize that the direct costs of treating headache are small in comparison with the huge indirect cost savings that might be made (e.g., by reducing lost working days) if resources were allocated to treat headache disorders appropriately. These evident burdens call for action. WHO recognizes this and partners with multiple nongovernmental organizations to address headache. WHO published the  Atlas of headache disorders  in 2011, describing the burden due to headache disorders and resources available to reduce them. In May 2022, the World Health Assembly endorsed the  Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders 2022–2031 . The action plan addresses the challenges and gaps in providing care and services for people with epilepsy and other neurological disorders such as headache disorders that exist worldwide and ensure a comprehensive, coordinated response across sectors. This includes raising policy prioritization and strengthening governance, providing effective, timely and responsive diagnosis, treatment and care, implementing strategies for promotion and prevention, fostering research and innovation and strengthening information systems. The  24 th  WHO Model List of Essential Medicines  presents a list of minimum medicine needs for headache disorders required for a basic health-care system, listing the most efficacious, safe and cost–effective medicines for priority conditions.

Migraine is characterized by recurring attacks and is often life-long. It is a primary headache disorder, that is in most cases episodic,  usually lasts 4–72 hours, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting and/or photophobia and phonophobia. It is sometimes preceded by an aura of reversable, visual, sensory or other symptoms. Migraine most often begins at puberty and generally affects those aged between 35 and 45 years. It is more common in women, possibly because of hormonal influences. Children typically experience migraine of shorter duration and abdominal symptoms are usually more prominent. The exact cause of migraine is currently unknown but it is thought to result from the release of pain producing inflammatory substances around the nerves and blood vessels of the head. It can be triggered by alcohol, sleep disruption and certain foods. Attacks typically include headache, which is often: Tension-type headaches (TTH) are described as pressure or tightness, often like a band around the head, sometimes spreading into or from the neck. They may be stress-related or associated with musculoskeletal problems in the neck. They often begin during the teenage years and affect 50% more woman than men. Episodic TTH, occurring on fewer than 15 days per month, is reported by more than 70% of some populations. Episodic TTH attacks usually last a few hours but can persist for several days.  Chronic TTH can be unremitting and is more disabling than episodic TTH.  Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache disorder characterized by frequently recurring (up to several times a day), brief but extremely severe headache, usually focused in or around one eye, with tearing and redness of the eye. The nose often runs or is blocked on the affected side and the eyelid may droop. CH is relatively uncommon affecting fewer than 1 in 1000 adults, affecting six men to each woman. Most people developing CH are in their 20s or older. CH has episodic and chronic forms. Medication-overuse headaches (MOH) are caused by chronic and excessive use of medication to treat headache. MOH is the most common secondary headache disorder. It may affect up to 5% of some populations, women more than men. MOH occurs by definition on more days than not, is oppressive, persistent and often at its worst on awakening.  Migraines and other headaches can affect people's ability to work, through decreased productivity, and interpersonal relationships. Often people continue to try to work despite the debilitating symptoms that can occur. Headache-related productivity loss may affect people's careers and/or security, financial situation, relationships, and mental health. It also causes economic loss to companies and society. Many of those troubled by headaches do not receive effective diagnosis and care. Appropriate treatment of headache disorders requires training of health professionals, accurate diagnosis and recognition of the conditions, appropriate treatment with cost-effective medications, simple lifestyle modifications and patient education. The main classes of drugs to treat headache disorders include analgesics, anti-emetics, specific anti-migraine medications and prophylactic medications. For migraine treatment, analgesics need to be taken at the first sign of symptoms (such as visual aura) to prevent the associated headache. Simple interventions to educate people on medication overuse headaches, migraine triggers and lifestyle modifications are highly effective. Restricting or eliminating  alcohol , regular sleep and exercise schedules,  healthy diets , staying hydrated and using a headache calendar to identify other triggers are often all that is needed to provide relief.  Lack of knowledge among health care providers is the principal clinical barrier. Many people with headache disorders are not diagnosed and treated. In many countries medications, such as sumatriptan for migraines, are not available. Poor awareness extends to the general public. Headache disorders are not perceived by the public as serious since they are mostly episodic, do not cause death and are not contagious. The low consultation rates in developed countries may indicate that many affected people are unaware that effective treatments exist. Half of people with headache disorders are estimated to be self-treating.  Many governments, seeking to constrain health care costs, do not acknowledge the substantial burden of headache on society. They might not recognize that the direct costs of treating headache are small in comparison with the huge indirect cost savings that might be made (e.g., by reducing lost working days) if resources were allocated to treat headache disorders appropriately. These evident burdens call for action. WHO recognizes this and partners with multiple nongovernmental organizations to address headache. WHO published the  Atlas of headache disorders  in 2011, describing the burden due to headache disorders and resources available to reduce them. In May 2022, the World Health Assembly endorsed the  Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders 2022–2031 . The action plan addresses the challenges and gaps in providing care and services for people with epilepsy and other neurological disorders such as headache disorders that exist worldwide and ensure a comprehensive, coordinated response across sectors. This includes raising policy prioritization and strengthening governance, providing effective, timely and responsive diagnosis, treatment and care, implementing strategies for promotion and prevention, fostering research and innovation and strengthening information systems. The  24 th  WHO Model List of Essential Medicines  presents a list of minimum medicine needs for headache disorders required for a basic health-care system, listing the most efficacious, safe and cost–effective medicines for priority conditions.

{"title": "Menopause", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "For most women, menopause is marked by the end of monthly menstruation (also known as a menstrual period or ‘period’) due to loss of ovarian follicular function. This means that the ovaries stop releasing eggs for fertilization.  The regularity and length of the menstrual cycle varies across a woman’s reproductive life span, but the age at which natural menopause occurs is generally between 45 and 55 years for women worldwide.   Natural menopause is deemed to have occurred after 12 consecutive months without menstruation for which there is no other obvious physiological or pathological cause and in the absence of clinical intervention. Some women experience menopause earlier (before 40 years of age). This premature menopause may be because of certain chromosomal abnormalities, autoimmune disorders or other unknown causes.   It is not possible to predict when an individual woman will experience menopause, although there are associations between the age at menopause and certain demographic, health and genetic factors.  Menopause can also be induced as a consequence of surgical procedures that involve removal of both ovaries or medical interventions that cause cessation of ovarian function (for example radiation therapy or chemotherapy). Many women have already stopped menstruating before menopause, for example those who have had certain surgical procedures (hysterectomy or surgical removal of their uterine lining) as well as those using certain hormonal contraceptives and other medicines that cause infrequent or absent periods. They may still experience other changes related to the menopausal transition. The hormonal changes associated with menopause can affect physical, emotional, mental and social well-being. The symptoms experienced during and following the menopausal transition vary substantially from person to person. Some have few if any symptoms. For others, symptoms can be severe and affect daily activities and quality of life. Some can experience symptoms for several years. Symptoms associated with menopause include: Body composition and cardiovascular risk can also be affected. Women’s advantage over men in terms of cardiovascular disease gradually disappears with the significant decline in oestrogen levels after menopause. Menopause can also result in the weakening of the pelvic support structures, increasing the risk of pelvic organ prolapse. Loss of bone density at menopause is a significant contributor to higher rates of osteoporosis and fractures. There are a variety of non-hormonal and hormonal interventions that can help alleviate symptoms of menopause. Symptoms that impact on health and well-being should be discussed with a health-care provider to identify available management options, with consideration of medical history, values, and preferences.  Pregnancy is still possible during perimenopause. Contraception is recommended to avoid unintended pregnancy until after 12 consecutive months without menstruation. Pregnancy after menopause is unlikely without fertility treatment that involves the use of donor eggs or previously frozen embryos. During perimenopause and following menopause, it is still possible to acquire sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, through unprotected sexual contact, including oral, anal and vaginal sex. The thinning of the vaginal wall after menopause increases the chances of lesions and tears, thereby increasing the risk of HIV transmission during vaginal sex. It is critical to see menopause as just one point in a continuum of life stages. A woman’s health status entering the perimenopausal period will largely be determined by prior health and reproductive history, lifestyle and environmental factors. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms can be disruptive to personal and professional lives, and changes associated with menopause will affect a woman’s health as she ages. Therefore, perimenopausal care plays an important role in the promotion of healthy ageing and quality of life. Menopause can be an important transition from a social perspective, as well as a biological one. Socially, a women’s experience of menopause may be influenced by gender norms, familial and sociocultural factors, including how female ageing and the menopausal transition are viewed in her culture.  The global population of postmenopausal women is growing. In 2021, women aged 50 and over accounted for 26% of all women and girls globally. This was up from 22% 10 years earlier  (1) . Additionally, women are living longer. Globally, a woman aged 60 years in 2019 could expect to live on average another 21 years  (2) .  Menopause can offer an important opportunity to reassess one’s health, lifestyle, and goals. Perimenopausal women need access to quality health services and communities and systems that can support them. Unfortunately, both awareness and access to menopause-related information and services remain a significant challenge in most countries. Menopause is often not discussed within families, communities, workplaces, or health-care settings.  Women may not know that symptoms they experience are related to menopause, or that there are counselling and treatment options that can help alleviate discomfort. Those experiencing menopausal symptoms may feel embarrassed or ashamed to draw attention to their experiences and ask for support.  Health-care providers may not be trained to recognize perimenopausal and post-menopausal symptoms and counsel patients on treatment options and staying healthy after the menopausal transition. Menopause currently receives limited attention in the training curricula for many health-care workers.  The sexual well-being of menopausal women is overlooked in many countries. This means that common gynaecological effects of menopause, including vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse, may go unaddressed. Similarly, older women may not consider themselves at risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV  (3) , or may not be counselled by their providers to practice safer sex or get tested.  Many governments do not have health polices and financing for the inclusion of menopause-related diagnosis, counselling, and treatment services as part of their routinely available services. Menopause-related services are a particular challenge in settings where there are often other urgent and competing priorities for health funding. WHO considers that social, psychological and physical health support during the menopausal transition and after menopause should be an integral part of health care. WHO is committed to increasing understanding of menopause by:   Notes 1) Whilst most personal experiences with menopause relate to cisgender women (who were born female and identify as female), transgender men and some people who identify as neither men nor women also experience menopause.   This fact sheet refers to “women” in alignment with the available data, which does not routinely identify gender identity. There is a paucity of readily available data on trans and gender diverse experiences of menopause. Trans and gender diverse people have unique age-related health needs that clinicians should consider, including referral to specialist services when necessary. 2) Although menopause is not a disease, this fact sheet refers to the perimenopausal and postmenopausal experiences of women as symptoms because they can result in a level of discomfort that affects their quality of life.   References", "Overview": "For most women, menopause is marked by the end of monthly menstruation (also known as a menstrual period or ‘period’) due to loss of ovarian follicular function.

There is a paucity of readily available data on trans and gender diverse experiences of menopause. Trans and gender diverse people have unique age-related health needs that clinicians should consider, including referral to specialist services when necessary. 2) Although menopause is not a disease, this fact sheet refers to the perimenopausal and postmenopausal experiences of women as symptoms because they can result in a level of discomfort that affects their quality of life.   References", "The importance of understanding menopause": "It is critical to see menopause as just one point in a continuum of life stages. A woman’s health status entering the perimenopausal period will largely be determined by prior health and reproductive history, lifestyle and environmental factors. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms can be disruptive to personal and professional lives, and changes associated with menopause will affect a woman’s health as she ages. Therefore, perimenopausal care plays an important role in the promotion of healthy ageing and quality of life. Menopause can be an important transition from a social perspective, as well as a biological one. Socially, a women’s experience of menopause may be influenced by gender norms, familial and sociocultural factors, including how female ageing and the menopausal transition are viewed in her culture.  The global population of postmenopausal women is growing. In 2021, women aged 50 and over accounted for 26% of all women and girls globally. This was up from 22% 10 years earlier  (1) . Additionally, women are living longer. Globally, a woman aged 60 years in 2019 could expect to live on average another 21 years  (2) .  Menopause can offer an important opportunity to reassess one’s health, lifestyle, and goals. Perimenopausal women need access to quality health services and communities and systems that can support them. Unfortunately, both awareness and access to menopause-related information and services remain a significant challenge in most countries. Menopause is often not discussed within families, communities, workplaces, or health-care settings.  Women may not know that symptoms they experience are related to menopause, or that there are counselling and treatment options that can help alleviate discomfort. Those experiencing menopausal symptoms may feel embarrassed or ashamed to draw attention to their experiences and ask for support.  Health-care providers may not be trained to recognize perimenopausal and post-menopausal symptoms and counsel patients on treatment options and staying healthy after the menopausal transition. Menopause currently receives limited attention in the training curricula for many health-care workers.  The sexual well-being of menopausal women is overlooked in many countries. This means that common gynaecological effects of menopause, including vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse, may go unaddressed. Similarly, older women may not consider themselves at risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV  (3) , or may not be counselled by their providers to practice safer sex or get tested.  Many governments do not have health polices and financing for the inclusion of menopause-related diagnosis, counselling, and treatment services as part of their routinely available services. Menopause-related services are a particular challenge in settings where there are often other urgent and competing priorities for health funding. WHO considers that social, psychological and physical health support during the menopausal transition and after menopause should be an integral part of health care.

{"title": "Meningitis", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Meningitis is the inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It can be infectious or non-infectious in origin, can be associated with high risk of death and long-term complications, and requires urgent medical care. Meningitis remains a significant global health threat. It can be caused by several species of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Injuries, cancers and drugs cause a small number of cases. Bacterial meningitis is the most serious type of meningitis. It is a severe, life-threatening condition that can often lead to long-term adverse health consequences. There are four main causes of acute bacterial meningitis: These bacteria are responsible for more than half of the deaths from meningitis globally and can cause other severe diseases like sepsis and pneumonia. Additional important causes of meningitis worldwide include other bacteria species (e.g.  Mycobacterium tuberculosis , non-typhoidal  Salmonella spp , Listeria monocytogenes), viruses (e.g. enteroviruses, herpesviruses an arboviruses), fungi (e.g.  Cyptococcus spp.),  and parasites (e.g. some species of amoebae).  Meningitis can affect anyone anywhere, and at any age. The pathogens that cause it can vary, based on a person’s age and immune system, and level of exposure to risk, which can be influenced by their living conditions and geographical location. Newborn babies are most at risk from Group B streptococcus, whereas children and adolescents are at most risk of meningococcus, pneumococcus and  Haemophilus influenzae . Pneumococcus and meningococcus also account for most cases of bacterial meningitis among adults.  Immunocompromised and/or people living with HIV are at increased risk of different types of meningitis.  Globally, the highest burden of disease is seen in a region of sub-Saharan Africa, known as the African meningitis belt, which stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia, and is at high risk of recurrent epidemics of meningococcal meningitis. Meningococcal meningitis outbreaks occur more frequently under special risk conditions, such as crowded settings where people are in close proximity, mining areas, mass gatherings, such as religious or sporting events, settings with refugees or displaced persons, closed institutions, military camps and areas with high migration, such as high-traffic markets and border areas. The route of transmission varies by organism. Most bacteria that cause meningitis, including meningococcus, pneumococcus and  Haemophilus influenzae , are carried in the human nose and throat. They are spread from person to person by respiratory droplets or throat secretions. Group B streptococcus is often carried in the human gut or vagina and can spread from mother to child around the time of birth. Carriage of these organisms is usually harmless and contributes to building up immunity against infection, but the bacteria occasionally invade the body, causing meningitis, sepsis and other forms of invasive disease. The symptoms of meningitis can differ based on the cause, how quickly the disease progresses, how long it lasts, brain involvement, and other serious complications like sepsis. Common symptoms of meningitis are fever, neck stiffness, confusion or altered mental status, headache, sensitivity to light, nausea and vomiting. Less frequent symptoms include seizures, coma and neurological deficits, such as weakness of the limbs.  Infants often have different symptoms compared to adults: Some bacterial pathogens may also account for other symptoms as a result of bloodstream infection, which can quickly lead to sepsis, including cold hands and feet, fast breathing and low blood pressure. A characteristic, non-blanching skin rash may appear with meningococcal sepsis.  One in 5 people surviving an episode of bacterial meningitis may have long lasting after-effects. These after-effects include hearing loss, seizures, limb weakness, difficulties with vision, speech, language, memory and communication, as well as scarring and limb amputations after sepsis.  Vaccines offer the best protection against common types of bacterial meningitis. Vaccines can prevent meningitis caused by:  Maternal Group B streptococcus vaccines to prevent invasive GBS disease in infants are in the final stages of clinical development.  Bacterial and viral meningitis can spread from person to person. If you live with someone who has either type of meningitis, you should: Licensed vaccines against meningococcal, pneumococcal and  Haemophilus influenzae  disease have been available for many years. These bacteria have several different strains (known as serotypes or serogroups) and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful strains. No universal vaccine exists. Hib vaccine is used in most national childhood immunization programmes globally. WHO also recommends universal use pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV).   Meningococcal vaccines  include multivalent polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (MMCV), which include 4 to 5 meningococcal serogroups (A,C,W,Y,X); protein-based vaccines, which include meningococcal serogroup B, and combination vaccines combining the latter with 4-valent MMCV. Polysaccharide vaccines are still marketed internationally but are gradually being replaced by MMCV. In the African meningitis belt, meningococcus serogroup A accounted for 80–85% of meningitis epidemics before the large-scale deployment of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine starting in 2010. In 2023, the first pentavalent MMCV protecting against serogroups A, C, W, Y and X (Men5CV) was prequalified by WHO and recommended for use in countries of the African meningitis belt. Roll-out of Men5CV has the potential to eliminate meningitis epidemics and make the meningitis belt history. Post-exposure prophylaxis with antibiotics is given to close contacts of individuals with meningococcal disease to eradicate asymptomatic meningococcal carriage in the nose and decrease the risk of transmission.  Identifying mothers whose babies are at risk of getting Group B streptococcal (GBS) disease is recommended in many countries. Mothers at risk of transmitted GBS to their babies are offered intravenous penicillin during labour to prevent their babies developing GBS infection. To diagnose meningitis, a lumbar puncture is needed to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This should be done before starting antibiotics; however, if bacterial meningitis is suspected based on the signs and symptoms, a lumbar puncture should never delay antibiotic treatment.  Laboratories will then perform specific tests with CSF or blood to identify the pathogen causing the infection. The tests will also help identify the treatments needed, and specifically for bacterial infections the susceptibility to types of antibiotics, as well as identify the strain(s) of the pathogen responsible and inform public health responses. Meningitis is a medical emergency and requires urgent medical attention in an appropriate health-care facility. Antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible when bacterial meningitis is suspected. The first dose of antibiotic treatment should not be delayed until the results of the lumbar puncture are available. The choice of antibiotic treatment should consider the age of the patient, presence of immunosuppression, and local prevalence of antimicrobial resistance patterns. In non-epidemic settings, intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) are initiated with the first dose of antibiotics to reduce the inflammatory response and the risk of neurological sequelae and death, Those who have lived through meningitis   can have complications such as deafness, learning impairment or behavioural problem and require long-term treatment and care. The ongoing psychosocial impacts of disability from meningitis can have medical, educational, social and human rights-based implications. Access to both services and support for these conditions is often insufficient, especially in low- and middle-income countries.  Individuals and families with members disabled by meningitis should be encouraged to seek services and guidance from local and national organizations of disabled people and other disability focused organizations, which can provide vital advice about legal rights, economic opportunities and social engagement to ensure people disabled by meningitis are able to live full and rewarding lives. WHO has also developed an  Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders  to address the many challenges and gaps in providing care and services for people with epilepsy and other neurological disorders that exist worldwide, including those suffering from meningitis sequelae.  Surveillance, from case detection to investigation and laboratory confirmation, is essential to the control of meningitis. Main objectives include: In 2020, the 73 rd  World Health Assembly approved resolution (WHA73.9), in which all Member States committed to implementing the  Defeating meningitis by 2030 global road map .

Common symptoms of meningitis are fever, neck stiffness, confusion or altered mental status, headache, sensitivity to light, nausea and vomiting. Less frequent symptoms include seizures, coma and neurological deficits, such as weakness of the limbs.  Infants often have different symptoms compared to adults: Some bacterial pathogens may also account for other symptoms as a result of bloodstream infection, which can quickly lead to sepsis, including cold hands and feet, fast breathing and low blood pressure. A characteristic, non-blanching skin rash may appear with meningococcal sepsis.  One in 5 people surviving an episode of bacterial meningitis may have long lasting after-effects. These after-effects include hearing loss, seizures, limb weakness, difficulties with vision, speech, language, memory and communication, as well as scarring and limb amputations after sepsis.  Vaccines offer the best protection against common types of bacterial meningitis. Vaccines can prevent meningitis caused by:  Maternal Group B streptococcus vaccines to prevent invasive GBS disease in infants are in the final stages of clinical development.  Bacterial and viral meningitis can spread from person to person. If you live with someone who has either type of meningitis, you should: Licensed vaccines against meningococcal, pneumococcal and  Haemophilus influenzae  disease have been available for many years. These bacteria have several different strains (known as serotypes or serogroups) and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful strains. No universal vaccine exists. Hib vaccine is used in most national childhood immunization programmes globally. WHO also recommends universal use pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV).   Meningococcal vaccines  include multivalent polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (MMCV), which include 4 to 5 meningococcal serogroups (A,C,W,Y,X); protein-based vaccines, which include meningococcal serogroup B, and combination vaccines combining the latter with 4-valent MMCV. Polysaccharide vaccines are still marketed internationally but are gradually being replaced by MMCV. In the African meningitis belt, meningococcus serogroup A accounted for 80–85% of meningitis epidemics before the large-scale deployment of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine starting in 2010. In 2023, the first pentavalent MMCV protecting against serogroups A, C, W, Y and X (Men5CV) was prequalified by WHO and recommended for use in countries of the African meningitis belt. Roll-out of Men5CV has the potential to eliminate meningitis epidemics and make the meningitis belt history. Post-exposure prophylaxis with antibiotics is given to close contacts of individuals with meningococcal disease to eradicate asymptomatic meningococcal carriage in the nose and decrease the risk of transmission.  Identifying mothers whose babies are at risk of getting Group B streptococcal (GBS) disease is recommended in many countries. Mothers at risk of transmitted GBS to their babies are offered intravenous penicillin during labour to prevent their babies developing GBS infection. To diagnose meningitis, a lumbar puncture is needed to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This should be done before starting antibiotics; however, if bacterial meningitis is suspected based on the signs and symptoms, a lumbar puncture should never delay antibiotic treatment.  Laboratories will then perform specific tests with CSF or blood to identify the pathogen causing the infection. The tests will also help identify the treatments needed, and specifically for bacterial infections the susceptibility to types of antibiotics, as well as identify the strain(s) of the pathogen responsible and inform public health responses. Meningitis is a medical emergency and requires urgent medical attention in an appropriate health-care facility. Antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible when bacterial meningitis is suspected. The first dose of antibiotic treatment should not be delayed until the results of the lumbar puncture are available. The choice of antibiotic treatment should consider the age of the patient, presence of immunosuppression, and local prevalence of antimicrobial resistance patterns. In non-epidemic settings, intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) are initiated with the first dose of antibiotics to reduce the inflammatory response and the risk of neurological sequelae and death, Those who have lived through meningitis   can have complications such as deafness, learning impairment or behavioural problem and require long-term treatment and care.

{"title": "Measles", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death. Measles can affect anyone but is most common in children. Measles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body. Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus. Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every two to three years and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. An estimated 95 000 people died from measles in 2024 – mostly children under the age of five years, despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine. Accelerated immunization activities by countries, WHO, the Measles & Rubella Partnership, and other international partners successfully prevented an estimated 59 million deaths between 2000 and 2024. Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 780 000 in 2000 to 95 000 in 2024  (1) . Symptoms of measles usually begin 10–14 days after exposure to the virus. A prominent rash is the most visible symptom. Early symptoms usually last 4–7 days. They include: The rash begins about 7–18 days after exposure, usually on the face and upper neck. It spreads over about 3 days, eventually to the hands and feet. It usually lasts 5–6 days before fading. Most deaths from measles are from complications related to the disease. Complications can include: If a woman catches measles during pregnancy, this can be dangerous for the mother and can result in her baby being born prematurely with a low birth weight. Complications are most common in children under 5 years and adults over age 30. They are more likely in children who are malnourished, especially those without enough vitamin A or with a weak immune system from HIV or other diseases. Measles itself also weakens the immune system and can make the body “forget” how to protect itself against infections, leaving children extremely vulnerable. Any non-immune person (not vaccinated or vaccinated but did not develop immunity) can become infected. Unvaccinated young children and pregnant persons are at highest risk of severe measles complications. Measles is still common, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The overwhelming majority of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes or weak health infrastructures that struggle to reach all children with immunization. Damaged health infrastructure and health services in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict interrupt routine immunization and overcrowding in residential camps increases the risk of infection. Children with malnutrition or other causes of a weak immune system are at highest risk of death from measles. Measles is one of the world’s most contagious diseases, spread by contact with infected nasal or throat secretions (coughing or sneezing) or breathing the air that was breathed by someone with measles. The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. For this reason, it is very infectious. One person infected by measles can generate up to 18 secondary infections.  It can be transmitted by an infected person from four days prior to the onset of the rash to four days after the rash erupts. Measles outbreaks can result in severe complications and deaths, especially among young, malnourished children. In countries close to measles elimination, cases imported from other countries remain an important source of infection. There is no specific treatment for measles. Caregiving should focus on relieving symptoms, making the person comfortable and preventing complications.  Drinking enough water and treatments for dehydration can replace fluids lost to diarrhoea or vomiting. Eating a healthy diet is also important. Doctors may use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and ear and eye infections. All children or adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths. Community-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. All children should be vaccinated against measles. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive. Children should receive two doses of the vaccine to ensure they are immune. The first dose is usually given at 9 months of age in countries where measles is common and 12–15 months in other countries. A second dose should be given later in childhood, usually at 15–18 months. The measles vaccine is given alone or often combined with vaccines for mumps, rubella and/or varicella. Routine measles vaccination, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for reducing global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use for about 60 years and costs less than US$ 1 per child. The measles vaccine is also used in emergencies to stop outbreaks from spreading. The risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees, who should be vaccinated as soon as possible. Combining vaccines slightly increases the cost but allows for shared delivery and administration costs and importantly, adds the benefit of protection against rubella, the most common vaccine preventable infection that can infect babies in the womb. In 2024, 76% of children received both doses of the measles vaccine, and about 84% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, as not all children develop immunity from the first dose. Approximately 30 million infants remained under-protected against measles in 2024, according to WHO and UNICEF estimates.  In 2020, WHO and global stakeholders endorsed the Immunization Agenda 2021–2030. The Agenda aims to achieve the regional targets as a core indicator of impact, positioning measles as a tracer of a health system’s ability to deliver essential childhood vaccines. WHO published the  Measles and rubella strategic framework  in 2020, establishing seven necessary strategic priorities to achieve and sustain the regional measles and rubella elimination goals. Without sustained attention, hard-fought gains can easily be lost. Where children are unvaccinated, outbreaks occur. Based on current trends of measles vaccination coverage and incidence, the  WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE)  concluded that measles elimination is under threat, as the disease resurged in numerous countries that achieved, or were close to achieving, elimination. WHO continues to strengthen the  Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network  (GMRLN) to ensure timely diagnosis of measles and track the virus’ spread to assist countries in coordinating targeted vaccination activities and reduce deaths from this vaccine-preventable disease. The Immunization Agenda 2030 Measles & Rubella Partnership  (M&RP) is a partnership led by the American Red Cross, United Nations Foundation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Gavi, the Vaccines Alliance, the Gates Foundation, UNICEF and WHO, to achieve the IA2030 measles and rubella specific targets. Launched in 2001, as the Measles and Rubella Initiative, the revitalized Partnership is committed to ensuring no child dies from measles or is born with congenital rubella syndrome. The Partnership helps countries plan, fund and measure efforts to permanently stop measles and rubella   References 1.

Progress towards measles elimination – worldwide, 2000–2024, Weekly epidemiological record, No 48, 2025, 100, 591–604", "Who is at risk?": "Any non-immune person (not vaccinated or vaccinated but did not develop immunity) can become infected. Unvaccinated young children and pregnant persons are at highest risk of severe measles complications. Measles is still common, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The overwhelming majority of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes or weak health infrastructures that struggle to reach all children with immunization. Damaged health infrastructure and health services in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict interrupt routine immunization and overcrowding in residential camps increases the risk of infection. Children with malnutrition or other causes of a weak immune system are at highest risk of death from measles. Measles is one of the world’s most contagious diseases, spread by contact with infected nasal or throat secretions (coughing or sneezing) or breathing the air that was breathed by someone with measles. The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. For this reason, it is very infectious. One person infected by measles can generate up to 18 secondary infections.  It can be transmitted by an infected person from four days prior to the onset of the rash to four days after the rash erupts. Measles outbreaks can result in severe complications and deaths, especially among young, malnourished children. In countries close to measles elimination, cases imported from other countries remain an important source of infection. There is no specific treatment for measles. Caregiving should focus on relieving symptoms, making the person comfortable and preventing complications.  Drinking enough water and treatments for dehydration can replace fluids lost to diarrhoea or vomiting. Eating a healthy diet is also important. Doctors may use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and ear and eye infections. All children or adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths. Community-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. All children should be vaccinated against measles. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive. Children should receive two doses of the vaccine to ensure they are immune. The first dose is usually given at 9 months of age in countries where measles is common and 12–15 months in other countries. A second dose should be given later in childhood, usually at 15–18 months. The measles vaccine is given alone or often combined with vaccines for mumps, rubella and/or varicella. Routine measles vaccination, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for reducing global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use for about 60 years and costs less than US$ 1 per child. The measles vaccine is also used in emergencies to stop outbreaks from spreading. The risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees, who should be vaccinated as soon as possible. Combining vaccines slightly increases the cost but allows for shared delivery and administration costs and importantly, adds the benefit of protection against rubella, the most common vaccine preventable infection that can infect babies in the womb. In 2024, 76% of children received both doses of the measles vaccine, and about 84% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, as not all children develop immunity from the first dose. Approximately 30 million infants remained under-protected against measles in 2024, according to WHO and UNICEF estimates.  In 2020, WHO and global stakeholders endorsed the Immunization Agenda 2021–2030. The Agenda aims to achieve the regional targets as a core indicator of impact, positioning measles as a tracer of a health system’s ability to deliver essential childhood vaccines. WHO published the  Measles and rubella strategic framework  in 2020, establishing seven necessary strategic priorities to achieve and sustain the regional measles and rubella elimination goals. Without sustained attention, hard-fought gains can easily be lost. Where children are unvaccinated, outbreaks occur. Based on current trends of measles vaccination coverage and incidence, the  WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE)  concluded that measles elimination is under threat, as the disease resurged in numerous countries that achieved, or were close to achieving, elimination. WHO continues to strengthen the  Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network  (GMRLN) to ensure timely diagnosis of measles and track the virus’ spread to assist countries in coordinating targeted vaccination activities and reduce deaths from this vaccine-preventable disease. The Immunization Agenda 2030 Measles & Rubella Partnership  (M&RP) is a partnership led by the American Red Cross, United Nations Foundation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Gavi, the Vaccines Alliance, the Gates Foundation, UNICEF and WHO, to achieve the IA2030 measles and rubella specific targets.

{"title": "Malnutrition", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition addresses 3 broad groups of conditions: There are 4 broad sub-forms of undernutrition: wasting, stunting, underweight, and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals. Undernutrition makes children in particular much more vulnerable to disease and death. Low weight-for-height is known as wasting. It usually indicates recent and severe weight loss because a person has not had enough food to eat and/or they have had an infectious disease, such as diarrhoea, which has caused them to lose weight. A young child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Low height-for-age is known as stunting. It is the result of chronic or recurrent undernutrition, usually associated with poor socioeconomic conditions, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness, and/or inappropriate infant and young child feeding and care in early life. Stunting holds children back from reaching their physical and cognitive potential. Children with low weight-for-age are known as underweight. A child who is underweight may be stunted, wasted or both. Inadequacies in intake of vitamins and minerals often referred to as micronutrients, can also be grouped together. Micronutrients enable the body to produce enzymes, hormones and other substances that are essential for proper growth and development. Iodine, vitamin A, and iron are the most important in global public health terms; their deficiency represents a major threat to the health and development of populations worldwide, particularly children and pregnant women in low-income countries. Overweight and obesity is when a person is too heavy for his or her height. Abnormal or excessive fat accumulation can impair health. Body mass index (BMI) is an index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify overweight and obesity. It is defined as a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m²). In adults, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 or more, whereas obesity is a BMI of 30 or more.  Among children and adolescents, BMI thresholds for overweight and obesity vary by age. Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance between energy consumed (too much) and energy expended (too little). Globally, people are consuming foods and drinks that are more energy-dense (high in sugars and fats) and engaging in less physical activity. Diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) include cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and stroke, and often linked with high blood pressure), certain cancers, and diabetes. Unhealthy diets and poor nutrition are among the top risk factors for these diseases globally. In 2022, approximately 390 million adults aged 18 years and older worldwide were underweight, while 2.5 billion were overweight, including 890 million who were living with obesity. Among children and adolescents aged 5-19 years, 390 million were overweight, including 160 million who were living with obesity. Another 190 million were living with thinness (BMI-for-age more than two standard deviations below the reference median). In 2022, an estimated 149 million children under the age of 5 years were suffering from stunting, while 37 million were living with overweight or obesity. Nearly half of deaths among children under 5 years of age are linked to undernutrition. These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries.  Every country in the world is affected by one or more forms of malnutrition. Combating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the greatest global health challenges. Women, infants, children, and adolescents are at particular risk of malnutrition. Optimizing nutrition early in life –including the 1000 days from conception to a child’s second birthday – ensures the best possible start in life, with long-term benefits. Poverty amplifies the risk of, and risks from, malnutrition. People who are poor are more likely to be affected by different forms of malnutrition. Also, malnutrition increases health care costs, reduces productivity, and slows economic growth, which can perpetuate a cycle of poverty and ill-health. On 1 April 2016, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly proclaimed 2016–2025 the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition. The Decade is an unprecedented opportunity for addressing all forms of malnutrition. It sets a concrete timeline for implementation of the commitments made at the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) to meet a set of global nutrition targets and diet-related NCD targets by 2025, as well as relevant targets in the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  by 2030 – in particular, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture) and SDG 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages). Led by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition calls for policy action across 6 key areas: WHO aims for a world free of all forms of malnutrition, where all people achieve health and wellbeing. According to the 2016–2025 nutrition strategy, WHO works with Member States and partners towards universal access to effective nutrition interventions and to healthy diets from sustainable and resilient food systems. WHO uses its convening power to help set, align and advocate for priorities and policies that move nutrition forward globally; develops evidence-informed guidance based on robust scientific and ethical frameworks; supports the adoption of guidance and implementation of effective nutrition actions; and monitors and evaluates policy and programme implementation and nutrition outcomes. This work is framed by the  Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant, and young child nutrition , adopted by Member States through a World Health Assembly resolution in 2012. Actions to end malnutrition are also vital for achieving the diet-related targets of the   Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020 , the  Global strategy for women’s, children’s, and adolescent’s health 2016–2030 ,  and the  2030 Agenda for sustainable development .", "Various forms of malnutrition": "There are 4 broad sub-forms of undernutrition: wasting, stunting, underweight, and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals.

Led by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition calls for policy action across 6 key areas: WHO aims for a world free of all forms of malnutrition, where all people achieve health and wellbeing. According to the 2016–2025 nutrition strategy, WHO works with Member States and partners towards universal access to effective nutrition interventions and to healthy diets from sustainable and resilient food systems.

Among children and adolescents aged 5-19 years, 390 million were overweight, including 160 million who were living with obesity. Another 190 million were living with thinness (BMI-for-age more than two standard deviations below the reference median). In 2022, an estimated 149 million children under the age of 5 years were suffering from stunting, while 37 million were living with overweight or obesity. Nearly half of deaths among children under 5 years of age are linked to undernutrition. These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries.  Every country in the world is affected by one or more forms of malnutrition. Combating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the greatest global health challenges. Women, infants, children, and adolescents are at particular risk of malnutrition. Optimizing nutrition early in life –including the 1000 days from conception to a child’s second birthday – ensures the best possible start in life, with long-term benefits. Poverty amplifies the risk of, and risks from, malnutrition. People who are poor are more likely to be affected by different forms of malnutrition. Also, malnutrition increases health care costs, reduces productivity, and slows economic growth, which can perpetuate a cycle of poverty and ill-health.

{"title": "Malaria", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable. The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person. Symptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing. Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women and girls, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection.  Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse. Malaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female  Anopheles  mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated,  P. falciparum  malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours. There are 5  Plasmodium  parasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species –  P. falciparum  and  P. vivax  – pose the greatest threat.  P. falciparum  is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent.  P. vivax  is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. The other malaria species which can infect humans are  P. malariae, P. ovale  and  P. knowlesi . The most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills. Symptoms usually start within 10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms may be mild for some people, especially for those who have had a malaria infection before. Because some malaria symptoms are not specific, getting tested early is important.  Some types of malaria can cause severe illness and death. Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk. Severe symptoms include: People with severe symptoms should get emergency care right away. Getting treatment early for mild malaria can stop the infection from becoming severe.  Malaria infection during pregnancy can also cause premature delivery or delivery of a baby with low birth weight.  According to the latest World malaria report, there were 282 million cases of malaria in 2024, an increase of about 9 million cases (3%) compared with 2023. The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 610 000 in 2024 compared to 598 000 in 2023. The WHO African Region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2024 the Region was home to about 95% of all malaria cases and  deaths. Children under 5 years of age accounted for about 76% of all malaria deaths in the Region. Over half of all deaths in the Region occurred in three countries: Nigeria (31.9%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (11.7%), and Niger (6.1%). Children under 5 years of age accounted for about 75% of all malaria deaths in the Region. Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines. Talk to a doctor about taking medicines such as chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas where malaria is common. Lower the risk of getting malaria by avoiding mosquito bites:   Vector control  is a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies as it is highly effective in preventing infection and reducing disease transmission. The 2 core interventions are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).  Progress in global malaria control is threatened by emerging resistance to insecticides among  Anopheles  mosquitoes. However, new generation nets, which provide better protection against malaria than pyrethroid-only nets, are becoming more widely available and represent an important tool in global efforts to combat malaria.  Anopheles stephensi  presents an added challenge for malaria control in Africa. Originally native to parts of south Asia and the Arabian Peninsula, the invasive mosquito species has been expanding its range over the last decade, with detections reported to date in eight African countries.  An. stephensi  thrives in urban settings, endures high temperatures and is resistant to many of the insecticides used in public health. Travellers to malaria endemic areas should consult their doctor several weeks before departure. The medical professional will determine which chemoprophylaxis drugs are appropriate for the country of destination. In some cases, chemoprophylaxis drugs must be started 2–3 weeks before departure. All prophylactic drugs should be taken on schedule for the duration of the stay in the malaria risk area and should be continued for 4 weeks after the last possible exposure to infection since parasites may still emerge from the liver during this period. Preventive chemotherapy  is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infections and their consequences. It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipients are infected with malaria.  Preventive chemotherapy includes perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and school-aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA). These safe and cost-effective strategies are intended to complement ongoing malaria control activities, including vector control measures, prompt diagnosis of suspected malaria, and treatment of confirmed cases with antimalarial medicines. Since October 2021, WHO has recommended broad use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine among children living in regions with moderate to high  P. falciparum  malaria transmission. The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria, among young children. In October 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M. Vaccines are now being rolled out in routine childhood immunization programmes across Africa.  Malaria vaccines in Africa are expected to save tens of thousands of young lives every year. The highest impact will be achieved, however, when the vaccines are introduced alongside a mix of other WHO-recommended malaria interventions such as bed nets and chemoprophylaxis. Questions and answers on malaria vaccines Early diagnosis and treatment  of malaria reduces disease, prevents deaths and contributes to reducing transmission. WHO recommends that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed using parasite-based  diagnostic testing  (through either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test).  Malaria is a serious infection and always requires treatment with medicine.  Multiple medicines are used to prevent and treat malaria. Doctors will choose one or more based on:  These are the most common medicines for malaria: Most medicines used are in pill form. Some people may need to go to a health centre or hospital for injectable medicines.  Subsequent to the emergence of partial artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, WHO is very concerned about confirmed partial artemisinin resistance in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. Based on available evidence, such resistance is also suspected in Ethiopia, Namibia, Sudan and Zambia.  In 2022, WHO developed a  strategy to curb antimalarial drug resistance in Africa . Regular monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy is needed to inform treatment policies in malaria-endemic countries, and to ensure early detection of, and response to, drug resistance. For more on WHO’s work on antimalarial drug resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, visit the  Mekong Malaria Elimination Programme  webpage.  Most rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria target one or two specific proteins produced by the  P. falciparum  malaria parasite: HRP2 and HRP3. However, parasites with genetic mutations, that prevent the expression of these proteins, are not detected by these tests. This means that malaria patients may not be diagnosed, allowing these mutated parasites to spread. In 2024, these mutated parasites were reported in 42 malaria endemic countries; with Viet Nam reporting for the first time in 2024. Although the estimated prevalence is still low in most countries, it exceeds 15% in Brazil, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Nicaragua and Peru. Malaria elimination is defined as the interruption of local transmission of a specified malaria parasite species in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate activities. Continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required. Countries and territories certified malaria-free by WHO . Malaria surveillance  is the continuous and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of malaria-related data, and the use of that data in the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice. Improved surveillance of malaria cases and deaths helps ministries of health determine which areas or population groups are most affected and enables countries to monitor changing disease patterns. Strong malaria surveillance systems also help countries design effective health interventions and evaluate the impact of their malaria control programmes. The WHO  Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030 , updated in 2021, provides a technical framework for all malaria-endemic countries. It is intended to guide and support regional and country programmes as they work towards malaria control and elimination.

Originally native to parts of south Asia and the Arabian Peninsula, the invasive mosquito species has been expanding its range over the last decade, with detections reported to date in eight African countries.  An. stephensi  thrives in urban settings, endures high temperatures and is resistant to many of the insecticides used in public health. Travellers to malaria endemic areas should consult their doctor several weeks before departure. The medical professional will determine which chemoprophylaxis drugs are appropriate for the country of destination. In some cases, chemoprophylaxis drugs must be started 2–3 weeks before departure. All prophylactic drugs should be taken on schedule for the duration of the stay in the malaria risk area and should be continued for 4 weeks after the last possible exposure to infection since parasites may still emerge from the liver during this period. Preventive chemotherapy  is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infections and their consequences. It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipients are infected with malaria.  Preventive chemotherapy includes perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and school-aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA). These safe and cost-effective strategies are intended to complement ongoing malaria control activities, including vector control measures, prompt diagnosis of suspected malaria, and treatment of confirmed cases with antimalarial medicines. Since October 2021, WHO has recommended broad use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine among children living in regions with moderate to high  P. falciparum  malaria transmission. The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria, among young children. In October 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M. Vaccines are now being rolled out in routine childhood immunization programmes across Africa.  Malaria vaccines in Africa are expected to save tens of thousands of young lives every year. The highest impact will be achieved, however, when the vaccines are introduced alongside a mix of other WHO-recommended malaria interventions such as bed nets and chemoprophylaxis. Questions and answers on malaria vaccines Early diagnosis and treatment  of malaria reduces disease, prevents deaths and contributes to reducing transmission. WHO recommends that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed using parasite-based  diagnostic testing  (through either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test).  Malaria is a serious infection and always requires treatment with medicine.  Multiple medicines are used to prevent and treat malaria. Doctors will choose one or more based on:  These are the most common medicines for malaria: Most medicines used are in pill form. Some people may need to go to a health centre or hospital for injectable medicines.  Subsequent to the emergence of partial artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, WHO is very concerned about confirmed partial artemisinin resistance in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. Based on available evidence, such resistance is also suspected in Ethiopia, Namibia, Sudan and Zambia.  In 2022, WHO developed a  strategy to curb antimalarial drug resistance in Africa . Regular monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy is needed to inform treatment policies in malaria-endemic countries, and to ensure early detection of, and response to, drug resistance. For more on WHO’s work on antimalarial drug resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, visit the  Mekong Malaria Elimination Programme  webpage.  Most rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria target one or two specific proteins produced by the  P. falciparum  malaria parasite: HRP2 and HRP3. However, parasites with genetic mutations, that prevent the expression of these proteins, are not detected by these tests. This means that malaria patients may not be diagnosed, allowing these mutated parasites to spread. In 2024, these mutated parasites were reported in 42 malaria endemic countries; with Viet Nam reporting for the first time in 2024. Although the estimated prevalence is still low in most countries, it exceeds 15% in Brazil, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Nicaragua and Peru. Malaria elimination is defined as the interruption of local transmission of a specified malaria parasite species in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate activities. Continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required. Countries and territories certified malaria-free by WHO . Malaria surveillance  is the continuous and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of malaria-related data, and the use of that data in the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice. Improved surveillance of malaria cases and deaths helps ministries of health determine which areas or population groups are most affected and enables countries to monitor changing disease patterns.

{"title": "Lymphatic filariasis", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Lymphatic filariasis (LF), commonly known as elephantiasis, is a neglected tropical disease. Infection occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. Infection is usually acquired in childhood and causes hidden damage to the lymphatic system. The painful and profoundly disfiguring visible manifestations of the disease – lymphoedema, elephantiasis and scrotal swelling – occur later in life and can lead to permanent disability. People affected by LF are not only physically disabled, but suffer mental, social and financial losses contributing to stigma and poverty. In 2023, 657 million people in 39 countries were living in areas that require preventive chemotherapy to stop the spread of infection. The global baseline estimate of people affected by lymphatic filariasis was 25 million men with hydrocele and over 15 million people with lymphoedema. At least 36 million people remain with these chronic disease manifestations. Eliminating lymphatic filariasis can prevent unnecessary suffering and contribute to the reduction of poverty. Lymphatic filariasis is caused by infection with parasites classified as nematodes (roundworms) of the family Filariodidea. There are 3 types of these thread-like filarial worms: Adult worms nest in the lymphatic vessels and disrupt the normal function of the lymphatic system. The worms can live for approximately 6–8 years and, during their life time, produce millions of microfilariae (immature larvae) that circulate in the blood. Mosquitoes are infected with microfilariae by ingesting blood when biting an infected host. Microfilariae mature into infective larvae within the mosquito. When infected mosquitoes bite people, mature parasite larvae are deposited on the skin, from where they can enter the body. The larvae then migrate to the lymphatic vessels where they develop into adult worms, thus continuing a cycle of transmission. Lymphatic filariasis is transmitted by different types of mosquitoes, for example by the  Culex  mosquito, widespread across urban and semi-urban areas,  Anopheles , mainly found in rural areas, and  Aedes , mainly in endemic islands in the Pacific.  Lymphatic filariasis infection involves asymptomatic, acute and chronic conditions. The majority of infections are asymptomatic, showing no external signs of infection while contributing to the transmission of the parasite. These asymptomatic infections still cause damage to the lymphatic system and the kidneys and alter the body's immune system. When lymphatic filariasis develops into chronic conditions it leads to lymphoedema (tissue swelling) or elephantiasis (skin/tissue thickening) of limbs and hydrocele (scrotal swelling). Involvement of breasts and genital organs is common. Such body deformities often lead to social stigma and sub-optimal mental health, loss of income-earning opportunities and increased medical expenses for patients and their caretakers. The socioeconomic burdens of isolation and poverty are immense. Acute episodes of local inflammation involving skin, lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels often accompany chronic lymphoedema or elephantiasis. Some of these episodes are caused by the body's immune response to the parasite. Most are the result of secondary bacterial skin infection where normal defenses have been partially lost due to underlying lymphatic damage. These acute attacks are debilitating, may last for weeks and are the primary cause of lost wages among people suffering with lymphatic filariasis. Elimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of the infection through preventive chemotherapy. The WHO recommended preventive chemotherapy strategy for lymphatic filariasis elimination is mass drug administration (MDA). MDA involves administering an annual dose of medicines to the entire at-risk population. The medicines used have a limited effect on adult parasites but effectively reduce the density of microfilariae in the bloodstream and prevent the spread of parasites to mosquitoes. The MDA regimen recommended depends on the co-endemicity of lymphatic filariasis with other filarial diseases. WHO recommends the following MDA regimens: diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) (6 mg/kg) and albendazole (400 mg) in countries without onchocerciasis; and  The impact of MDA depends on the efficacy of the regimen and the coverage (proportion of total population ingesting the medicines). MDA with the 2-medicine regimens have interrupted the transmission cycle when conducted annually for at least 4–6 years with effective coverage of the total population at risk. Salt fortified with DEC has also been used in a few unique settings to interrupt the transmission cycle. At the start of GPELF, 81 countries were considered endemic for lymphatic filariasis. Further epidemiological data reviewed since, indicate that preventive chemotherapy was not required in 10 countries. From 2000 to 2023, 9.7 billion cumulative treatments were delivered to more than 943 million people at least once in 71 countries, considerably reducing transmission in many places. The population requiring MDA has declined by 58.6% (871 million) where infection prevalence has been reduced below elimination thresholds. The overall economic benefit of the programme during 2000–2007 is conservatively estimated at US$ 24 billion. Treatments until 2015 are estimated to have averted at least US$ 100.5 billion of economic loss expected to have occurred over the lifetime of cohorts who have benefited from treatment. Twenty-one countries and territories (Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, the Cook Islands, Egypt, Kiribati, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Malawi, Marshall Islands, Niue, Palau, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Vanuatu, Viet Nam, Wallis and Futuna, and Yemen) are now acknowledged as achieving elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. By 2023, 14 countries had successfully implemented recommended strategies, stopped large-scale treatment and are under surveillance to demonstrate that elimination has been achieved. Preventive chemotherapy is still required in 39 countries and within 6 of these countries MDA has not yet been delivered to all endemic areas as of the end of 2023.  Morbidity management and disability prevention are vital for improving public health and are essential services that should be provided by the health care system to ensure sustainability. Surgery can alleviate most cases of hydrocele. Clinical severity and progression of the disease, including acute inflammatory episodes, can be reduced and prevented with simple measures of hygiene, skin care, exercises and elevation of affected limbs. People with lymphoedema must have access to continuing care throughout their lives, both to manage the disease and to prevent progression to more advanced stages. The GPELF aims to provide access to an essential package of care for every person with associated chronic manifestations of lymphatic filariasis in all areas where the disease is present, thus alleviating suffering and promoting improvement in their quality of life. Goals toward the elimination of lymphatic filariasis will be achieved if affected people have access to the following essential package of care: Mosquito control is a supplemental strategy supported by WHO. It is used to reduce transmission of lymphatic filariasis and other mosquito-borne infections. Depending on the parasite-vector species, measures such as insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying or personal protection measures may help protect people from infection. The use of insecticide-treated nets in areas where  Anopheles  is the primary vector for filariasis enhances the impact on transmission during and after MDA. Historically, vector control has in select settings contributed to the elimination of lymphatic filariasis in the absence of large-scale preventive chemotherapy. World Health Assembly resolution WHA50.29 encourages Member States to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. In response, WHO launched its Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) in 2000.   WHO’s strategy is based on 2 key components:  In 2020, GPELF set the following goals for the new NTD Road Map (2021–2030):", "Overview": "Lymphatic filariasis (LF), commonly known as elephantiasis, is a neglected tropical disease.

These acute attacks are debilitating, may last for weeks and are the primary cause of lost wages among people suffering with lymphatic filariasis. Elimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of the infection through preventive chemotherapy. The WHO recommended preventive chemotherapy strategy for lymphatic filariasis elimination is mass drug administration (MDA). MDA involves administering an annual dose of medicines to the entire at-risk population. The medicines used have a limited effect on adult parasites but effectively reduce the density of microfilariae in the bloodstream and prevent the spread of parasites to mosquitoes. The MDA regimen recommended depends on the co-endemicity of lymphatic filariasis with other filarial diseases. WHO recommends the following MDA regimens: diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) (6 mg/kg) and albendazole (400 mg) in countries without onchocerciasis; and  The impact of MDA depends on the efficacy of the regimen and the coverage (proportion of total population ingesting the medicines). MDA with the 2-medicine regimens have interrupted the transmission cycle when conducted annually for at least 4–6 years with effective coverage of the total population at risk. Salt fortified with DEC has also been used in a few unique settings to interrupt the transmission cycle. At the start of GPELF, 81 countries were considered endemic for lymphatic filariasis. Further epidemiological data reviewed since, indicate that preventive chemotherapy was not required in 10 countries. From 2000 to 2023, 9.7 billion cumulative treatments were delivered to more than 943 million people at least once in 71 countries, considerably reducing transmission in many places. The population requiring MDA has declined by 58.6% (871 million) where infection prevalence has been reduced below elimination thresholds. The overall economic benefit of the programme during 2000–2007 is conservatively estimated at US$ 24 billion. Treatments until 2015 are estimated to have averted at least US$ 100.5 billion of economic loss expected to have occurred over the lifetime of cohorts who have benefited from treatment. Twenty-one countries and territories (Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, the Cook Islands, Egypt, Kiribati, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Malawi, Marshall Islands, Niue, Palau, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Vanuatu, Viet Nam, Wallis and Futuna, and Yemen) are now acknowledged as achieving elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. By 2023, 14 countries had successfully implemented recommended strategies, stopped large-scale treatment and are under surveillance to demonstrate that elimination has been achieved. Preventive chemotherapy is still required in 39 countries and within 6 of these countries MDA has not yet been delivered to all endemic areas as of the end of 2023.  Morbidity management and disability prevention are vital for improving public health and are essential services that should be provided by the health care system to ensure sustainability. Surgery can alleviate most cases of hydrocele. Clinical severity and progression of the disease, including acute inflammatory episodes, can be reduced and prevented with simple measures of hygiene, skin care, exercises and elevation of affected limbs. People with lymphoedema must have access to continuing care throughout their lives, both to manage the disease and to prevent progression to more advanced stages. The GPELF aims to provide access to an essential package of care for every person with associated chronic manifestations of lymphatic filariasis in all areas where the disease is present, thus alleviating suffering and promoting improvement in their quality of life. Goals toward the elimination of lymphatic filariasis will be achieved if affected people have access to the following essential package of care: Mosquito control is a supplemental strategy supported by WHO. It is used to reduce transmission of lymphatic filariasis and other mosquito-borne infections. Depending on the parasite-vector species, measures such as insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying or personal protection measures may help protect people from infection. The use of insecticide-treated nets in areas where  Anopheles  is the primary vector for filariasis enhances the impact on transmission during and after MDA. Historically, vector control has in select settings contributed to the elimination of lymphatic filariasis in the absence of large-scale preventive chemotherapy. World Health Assembly resolution WHA50.29 encourages Member States to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. In response, WHO launched its Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) in 2000.   WHO’s strategy is based on 2 key components:  In 2020, GPELF set the following goals for the new NTD Road Map (2021–2030):", "Treatment": "Elimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of the infection through preventive chemotherapy.

{"title": "Lung cancer", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Lung cancer is a type of cancer that starts when abnormal cells grow in an uncontrolled way in the lungs. It is a serious health issue that can cause severe harm and death. Symptoms of lung cancer include a cough that does not go away, chest pain and shortness of breath.  It is important to seek medical care early to avoid serious health effects. Treatments depend on the person’s medical history and the stage of the disease.  The most common types of lung cancer are non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) and small cell carcinoma (SCLC). NSCLC is more common and grows slowly, while SCLC is less common but often grows quickly. Lung cancer is a significant public health concern, causing a considerable number of deaths globally. GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) show as lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%) in 2020.  Smoking tobacco (including cigarettes, cigars, and pipes) is the primary risk factor for lung cancer but it can also affect non-smokers. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, occupational hazards (such as asbestos, radon and certain chemicals), air pollution, hereditary cancer syndromes, and previous chronic lung diseases.  Lung cancer can cause several symptoms that may indicate a problem in the lungs. The most common symptoms include:  Early symptoms may be mild or dismissed as common respiratory issues, leading to delayed diagnosis. Not smoking tobacco is the best way to prevent lung cancer.  Other risk factors to avoid include: Early treatment can prevent lung cancer from becoming worse and spreading to other parts of the body. Prevention of lung cancer include primary and secondary prevention measures. Primary prevention aims to prevent the initial occurrence of a disease through risk reduction and promoting healthy behaviour. In public health, these preventive measures include smoking cessation, promoting smoke-free environments, implementing tobacco control policies, addressing occupational hazards, and reducing air pollution levels.  Secondary prevention for lung cancer involves screening methods that aim to detect the disease in its early stages, before symptoms become apparent and can be indicated for high-risk individuals. In this population, early detection can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment and improve outcomes. The primary screening method for lung cancer is low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). Diagnostic methods for lung cancer include physical examination, imaging (such as chest X-rays, computed tomography scans, and magnetic resonance imaging), examination of the inside of the lung using a bronchoscopy, taking a sample of tissue (biopsy) for histopathology examination and definition of the specific subtype (NSCLC versus SCLC), and molecular testing to identify specific genetic mutations or biomarkers to guide the best treatment option.  Treatments for lung cancer are based on the type of cancer, how much it has spread, and the person’s medical history. Early detection of lung cancer can lead to better treatments and outcomes. Treatments include:  Surgery is often used in the early stages of lung cancer if the tumour has not spread to other areas of the body. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can help shrink the tumour. Doctors from several disciplines often work together to provide treatment and care of people with lung cancer. Supportive care is important for people with lung cancer. It aims to manage symptoms, provide pain relief, and give emotional support. It can help to increase quality of life for people with lung cancer and their families. a) Early stage disease : The primary treatment for early stage lung cancer (i.e. tumour limited to the lung, with no metastatic dissemination to distant organs or lymph nodes) is surgical removal of the tumour through procedures such as lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wedge resection. Neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgery) can help reduce tumour size, making it more manageable for surgical removal. Adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) is very often recommended after surgery to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. In cases where surgery is not feasible, radiation therapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may be used as the primary treatment. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy may also be considered based on specific tumour characteristics. Individualized treatment plans should be discussed with healthcare professionals. b) Advanced disease:  The treatment for metastatic stage lung cancer, where the cancer has spread to distant organs or lymph nodes, is based on various factors, including the patient's overall health, the extent and location of metastases, histology, genetic profile, and individual preferences. The primary goal is to prolong survival, alleviate symptoms, and improve quality of life.   Systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, play a crucial role in the treatment of metastatic lung cancer.  Chemotherapy is often the first-line treatment for the majority of patients around the world and involves the use of drugs that circulate throughout the body to kill cancer cells. Combination chemotherapy regimens are commonly used, and the choice of drugs depends on factors such as the histological type of the cancer and the patient's general health conditions. Targeted therapy, designed to block the signalling pathways that drive the growth of cancer cells, is an important option for patients with specific genetic mutations or biomarkers identified in their tumour. Immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic lung cancer. These drugs help to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Local treatments, such as radiation therapy and surgery, may be used to manage specific metastatic sites or alleviate symptoms caused by tumour growth. Clinical trials offer opportunities to access novel treatments or experimental therapies for patients. Participation in clinical trials helps advance medical knowledge and potentially offers new treatment options. WHO recognizes the significant impact of lung cancer on global health and has implemented several initiatives to address the disease comprehensively. The WHO's response focuses on tobacco control, cancer prevention, early detection, and improving access to quality treatment and care. WHO supports countries in implementing evidence-based tobacco control policies, including increasing tobacco taxes, enforcing comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship, and implementing strong graphic health warnings on tobacco products.  The Organization also promotes cancer prevention strategies by advocating for healthy lifestyles, including regular physical activity, a healthy diet, and minimizing exposure to environmental risk factors. Additionally, WHO supports early detection programs and encourages countries to implement screening measures for high-risk populations to detect lung cancer at earlier stages when treatment options are more effective. Last, WHO works towards ensuring access to quality treatment and care for lung cancer patients by providing technical guidance to member states, promoting equitable access to essential cancer medicines, and fostering international collaboration to share best practices and improve cancer care outcomes.", "Symptoms": "Lung cancer can cause several symptoms that may indicate a problem in the lungs.

WHO recognizes the significant impact of lung cancer on global health and has implemented several initiatives to address the disease comprehensively. The WHO's response focuses on tobacco control, cancer prevention, early detection, and improving access to quality treatment and care. WHO supports countries in implementing evidence-based tobacco control policies, including increasing tobacco taxes, enforcing comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship, and implementing strong graphic health warnings on tobacco products.  The Organization also promotes cancer prevention strategies by advocating for healthy lifestyles, including regular physical activity, a healthy diet, and minimizing exposure to environmental risk factors. Additionally, WHO supports early detection programs and encourages countries to implement screening measures for high-risk populations to detect lung cancer at earlier stages when treatment options are more effective. Last, WHO works towards ensuring access to quality treatment and care for lung cancer patients by providing technical guidance to member states, promoting equitable access to essential cancer medicines, and fostering international collaboration to share best practices and improve cancer care outcomes.", "Stages of care": "a) Early stage disease : The primary treatment for early stage lung cancer (i.e. tumour limited to the lung, with no metastatic dissemination to distant organs or lymph nodes) is surgical removal of the tumour through procedures such as lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wedge resection. Neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgery) can help reduce tumour size, making it more manageable for surgical removal. Adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) is very often recommended after surgery to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. In cases where surgery is not feasible, radiation therapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may be used as the primary treatment. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy may also be considered based on specific tumour characteristics. Individualized treatment plans should be discussed with healthcare professionals. b) Advanced disease:  The treatment for metastatic stage lung cancer, where the cancer has spread to distant organs or lymph nodes, is based on various factors, including the patient's overall health, the extent and location of metastases, histology, genetic profile, and individual preferences. The primary goal is to prolong survival, alleviate symptoms, and improve quality of life.   Systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, play a crucial role in the treatment of metastatic lung cancer.  Chemotherapy is often the first-line treatment for the majority of patients around the world and involves the use of drugs that circulate throughout the body to kill cancer cells. Combination chemotherapy regimens are commonly used, and the choice of drugs depends on factors such as the histological type of the cancer and the patient's general health conditions. Targeted therapy, designed to block the signalling pathways that drive the growth of cancer cells, is an important option for patients with specific genetic mutations or biomarkers identified in their tumour. Immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic lung cancer. These drugs help to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Local treatments, such as radiation therapy and surgery, may be used to manage specific metastatic sites or alleviate symptoms caused by tumour growth.

{"title": "Low back pain", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Low back pain (LBP) describes pain between the lower edge of the ribs and the buttock. It can last for a short time (acute), a little longer (sub-acute) or a long time (chronic). It can affect anyone.  LBP makes it hard to move and can affect quality of life and mental well-being. It can limit work activities and engagement with family and friends.  LBP can be specific or non-specific. Specific LBP is pain that is caused by a certain disease or structural problem in the spine, or when the pain radiates from another part of the body.  Non-specific LBP is when it isn’t possible to identify a specific disease or structural reason to explain the pain. LBP is non-specific in about 90% of cases. In all types and at all stages of LBP, rehabilitation is essential to reassure people and help them make sense of their pain, help them return to activities they enjoy and identify strategies to support recovery and improve function. Specialized care pathways may be needed for specific LBP. An estimated 619 million people live with LBP and it is the leading cause of disability worldwide. LBP is a major public health issue. LBP is often associated with loss of work productivity and thus produces huge economic burden on individuals and on societies.  Low back pain (LBP) has the highest prevalence globally among musculoskeletal conditions and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. It is the condition where the greatest number of people may benefit from rehabilitation.  People at any age can experience LBP, including children and adolescents. Most people experience LBP at some point in their lives. The peak in the number of cases occurs at 50–55 years, and women experience LBP more frequently than men. The prevalence and disability impact of LBP are greatest among older people aged 80–85 years. Recurrent LBP episodes are more common with ageing. Chronic LBP is a major cause of work loss and participation restriction and reduced quality of life around the world. Considering the high prevalence, LBP contributes to a huge economic burden on societies. It should be considered a global public health problem that requires an appropriate response. Low back pain can be a dull ache or sharp pain. It can also cause pain to radiate into other areas of the body, especially the legs. LBP can restrict a person’s movement, which can affect their work, school and community engagement. It can also cause problems with sleep, low mood and distress. LPB can be acute (lasting under 6 weeks), sub-acute (6–12 weeks) or chronic (over 12 weeks).  In most cases of acute LBP, symptoms go away on their own and most people will recover well. However, for some people the symptoms will continue and turn into chronic pain. People with LBP may also experience spine-related leg pain (sometimes called sciatica or radicular pain). This is often described as a dull sensation or a sharp, electric shock feeling. Numbness or tingling and weakness in some muscles may be experienced with the leg pain. When associated with LBP, radicular signs and symptoms are often due to involvement of a spinal nerve root. Some people may experience radicular symptoms without LBP, when a nerve is compressed or injured distal to the spinal column.  All these experiences affect well-being and quality of life and often lead to loss of work and retirement wealth, particularly in those who experience chronic symptoms. LBP may be classified as specific or non-specific. Non-specific means that the experience of pain cannot be confidently accounted for by another diagnosis such as an underlying disease, pathology or tissue damage. It is non-specific in about 90% of cases. Risk factors for non-specific LBP include low physical activity levels, smoking, obesity and high physical stress at work. Specific LBP can be explained by an underlying disease (e.g., cancer), tissue damage (e.g., fracture), or may be referred from other organs (e.g., from kidney or aortic aneurysm).  Treatment for LBP depends on the nature of the pain and whether it is non-specific or specific. For specific LBP, treatments focus on treating the underlying condition causing the pain.  Treatments for non-specific LBP include: Medicines can be used to reduce the symptoms of LBP and should ideally be combined with other treatments. Painkillers should not be the first-line treatment for LBP. Older people and those with other medical conditions should speak to a healthcare provider before using medicines. With the onset of any LBP, a comprehensive clinical assessment comprising a careful physical examination and a psychosocial assessment is essential to tailor care while considering a person’s values, preferences and care priorities.  The longer a person experiences LBP, the more likely that limitations in functioning will manifest. In these contexts, adopting a biopsychosocial approach to assessment and care planning becomes increasingly important. Rehabilitation includes sets of interventions that aim to achieve and maintain independence in daily living and optimal participation in meaningful activities, such as work and community life and to achieve well-being. Interventions for rehabilitation in LBP include non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic options, whereas non-pharmacological interventions have in most cases a high priority.  Self-care is an important part of managing LBP and returning to meaningful life activities.  There are several ways to reduce symptoms and help prevent further episodes of non-specific low back pain: Education and support can help people with low back pain to develop strategies to self-manage and cope with the symptoms. This helps to reduce  the impact of the disease and improve well-being. WHO is taking action to extend access to care for people with low back pain in different ways: WHO Rehabilitation 2030 Initiative:  The  Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation  provides information on essential interventions for rehabilitation (including assistive products), and human and material resources for 20 health conditions, including low back pain. UN Decade of Healthy Ageing: WHO recommends a reorientation of health and care systems to promote healthy ageing and address the diverse needs of older persons.  The  Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE)  approach promotes the person-centred assessment of the older person to guide the design of personalized, health and social care, including long-term care interventions. Specific recommendations are provided to prevent the loss of locomotor and psychological capacity because of pain. The  WHO Guideline on management of chronic primary low back pain in adults  (under development) will provide evidence-based recommendations about non-surgical care in primary and community care settings.   References 1.

Elimination of leprosy as a public health problem (defined as prevalence of less than 1 per 10 000 population as per World Health Assembly resolution 44.9) was achieved globally in the year 2000 and in most countries by the year 2010. The reduction in the number of new cases has been gradual. As per data of 2024, Brazil, India and Indonesia continue to report more than 10 000 new cases, while 12 other countries (Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka and the United Republic of Tanzania) each reported 1000–10 000 new cases. Fifty-five countries reported 0 cases and 117 reported fewer than 1000 new cases. The disease is believed to be transmitted through droplets from the nose and mouth of an untreated case of leprosy, containing the causative agent, following prolonged, close contact. The disease does not spread through casual contact (like shaking hands or hugging, sharing meals or sitting next to each other). The patient stops transmitting the disease upon initiation of treatment. The diagnosis of leprosy is done clinically. Laboratory-based services may be required in cases that are difficult to diagnose.  The disease manifests commonly through skin lesion and peripheral nerve involvement. Leprosy is diagnosed by finding at least one of the following cardinal signs: (i) definite loss of sensation in a pale (hypopigmented) or reddish skin patch; (ii) thickened or enlarged peripheral nerve, with loss of sensation and/or weakness of the muscles supplied by that nerve; (iii) microscopic detection of bacilli in a slit-skin smear. Based on the above, cases of leprosy are classified into two types for treatment purposes: a paucibacillary (PB) case and multibacillary (MB) case. PB case:  a case of leprosy with 1–5 skin lesions, without demonstrated presence of bacilli in a skin smear. MB case:  a case of leprosy with more than five skin lesions; or with nerve involvement (pure neuritis, or any number of skin lesions and neuritis); or with the demonstrated presence of bacilli in a slit-skin smear, irrespective of the number of skin lesions. Leprosy is a curable disease. The currently recommended treatment regimen consists of three medicines (dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine) and is referred to as multi-drug therapy (MDT). The same regimen with a duration of 6 months for PB and 12 months for MB cases has been recommended by WHO. MDT kills the pathogen and cures the patient. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can help to prevent disabilities. WHO has been providing MDT free of cost. Free MDT was initially funded by The Nippon Foundation (TNF) and has been donated by Novartis since 2000. Case detection and treatment with MDT alone have proven insufficient to interrupt transmission. WHO recommends contact screening (household, neighbourhood, and social contacts), accompanied by the administration of a single dose of rifampicin as post-exposure prophylaxis (SDR-PEP). WHO provides technical support to countries and territories on leprosy prevention and control. Every year, WHO collates epidemiological data on leprosy from countries and territories and publishes a consolidated report in English and French in the Weekly Epidemiological Record. After detailed consultations with countries, experts, partners and persons affected by leprosy, WHO released the  Towards zero leprosy: global leprosy (Hansen’s disease) strategy 2021–2030  aligned to the  Neglected tropical diseases road map 2021–2030 . The Strategy envisions zero leprosy: zero infection and disease, zero disability, zero stigma and discrimination. The four strategic pillars of the Strategy include: implementing integrated, country-owned zero leprosy roadmaps in all endemic countries; scaling up leprosy prevention alongside integrated active case detection; managing leprosy and its complications and prevent new disability; and combatting stigma and ensuring human rights are respected. The Strategy also recognizes the need for investment in research and includes a set of key research priorities.

{"title": "Lead poisoning", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the Earth’s crust. Its widespread use has caused extensive environmental contamination, human exposure and significant public health problems globally. Important sources of environmental contamination include mining, smelting, manufacturing and recycling activities, and lead use in a range of products. Most global lead consumption is for the manufacture of lead-acid batteries for motor vehicles. Lead is used in many products, including pigments, paints, solder, stained glass, lead crystal glassware, ammunition, ceramic glazes, jewellery, toys, some traditional cosmetics, and some traditional medicines. Lead can contaminate drinking water through plumbing systems containing lead pipes, solders and fittings. Young children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead and can suffer permanent adverse health impacts, particularly on the development of the central nervous system. Lead causes long-term harm in adults, including increased risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and kidney damage. Lead exposure during pregnancy can cause reduced fetal growth and preterm birth. People are exposed to lead through occupational and environmental sources. This mainly results from: Young children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning as they may absorb up to 4–5 times as much lead as adults from an ingested dose. Moreover, children’s innate curiosity and their age-appropriate and frequent hand-to-mouth and object-to-mouth behaviours increase their risk of exposure to lead-contaminated dust, soil and paint. Children who engage in pica, the compulsive, habitual consumption of non-food items, are at particularly high risk. Exposure to lead-contaminated soil and dust resulting from battery recycling and mining has caused outbreaks of mass lead poisoning, including deaths in young children, in some countries. Once lead enters the body, it is distributed to organs including the brain, kidneys, liver and bones. Lead is stored in the teeth and bones, where it accumulates over time. Lead stored in bone may be released into the blood during pregnancy and expose the fetus. Malnourished children are more susceptible to lead as they absorb more lead if other nutrients are deficient, especially calcium or iron.  Lead exposure can have serious consequences for the health of children. Exposure to very high levels of lead can severely damage the brain and central nervous system causing coma, convulsions and even death. Children who survive severe lead poisoning may be left with permanent intellectual disability and behavioural disorders. At lower levels of exposure that may have no obvious symptoms, lead can lead to a spectrum of injury across multiple body systems. In particular, lead can permanently affect children’s brain development, resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioural changes including reduced attention span and increased antisocial behaviour, and reduced educational attainment. Lead exposure also causes anaemia, hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to the reproductive organs.  There is no known safe blood lead concentration; even blood lead concentrations as low as 3.5 µg/dL may be associated with decreased intelligence in children, behavioural difficulties and learning problems  (1) . Lead exposure causes a significant burden of disease. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimates that more than 1.5 million deaths globally were attributed to lead exposure in 2021, primarily due to cardiovascular effects  (2) . Additionally, lead exposure was estimated to account for more than 33 million years lost to disability (disability-adjusted life years, or DALYs)   worldwide in 2021  (2) . WHO identifies lead as one of 10 chemicals of major public health concern requiring action by Member States to protect the health of workers, children and women of reproductive age. WHO publishes a range of resources on lead, including information for policy-makers, technical guidance, training materials and advocacy materials.  In 2021, WHO published  Guidelines on clinical management exposure to lead . The guidelines recommend that for individuals with blood lead concentration equal to or greater than 5 µg/dL, the source of lead exposure should be identified, and appropriate action taken to terminate exposure. Lead paint is a major source of exposure globally. WHO and UNEP lead the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint. It aims to encourage all countries to develop legally binding laws to control the use of lead in paint. As of January 2024, 48% of countries have  legally-binding controls on lead paint . WHO is preparing guidelines on prevention of lead exposure, which will provide policy-makers, public health authorities and health professionals with evidence-based guidance on the measures to protect the health of children and adults from lead exposure.   References", "Overview": "Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the Earth’s crust.

Exposure to very high levels of lead can severely damage the brain and central nervous system causing coma, convulsions and even death. Children who survive severe lead poisoning may be left with permanent intellectual disability and behavioural disorders. At lower levels of exposure that may have no obvious symptoms, lead can lead to a spectrum of injury across multiple body systems. In particular, lead can permanently affect children’s brain development, resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioural changes including reduced attention span and increased antisocial behaviour, and reduced educational attainment.

{"title": "Influenza (seasonal)", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Seasonal influenza (the flu) is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses. It is common in all parts of the world. Most people recover without treatment. Influenza spreads easily between people when they cough or sneeze. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease. Symptoms of influenza include acute onset of fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and fatigue. Treatment should aim to relieve symptoms. People with the flu should rest and drink plenty of liquids. Most people will recover on their own within a week. Medical care may be needed in severe cases and for people with risk factors. There are 4 types of influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B viruses circulate and cause  seasonal epidemics  of disease.  Symptoms of influenza usually begin around 2 days after being infected by someone who has the virus.  Symptoms include: The cough can be severe and can last 2 weeks or more.  Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring medical attention. However, influenza can cause severe illness or death, especially in people at high risk. Influenza can worsen symptoms of other chronic diseases. In severe cases influenza can lead to pneumonia and sepsis. People with other medical issues or who have severe symptoms should seek medical care. Hospitalization and death due to influenza occur mainly among high-risk groups.  In industrialized countries most deaths associated with influenza occur among people aged 65 years or older  (1) .  The effects of seasonal influenza epidemics in developing countries are not fully known, but research estimates that 99% of deaths in children under 5 years of age with influenza related lower respiratory tract infections are in developing countries  (2) .  All age groups can be affected but there are groups that are more at risk than others. Epidemics can result in high levels of worker/school absenteeism and productivity losses. Clinics and hospitals can be overwhelmed during peak illness periods.  Seasonal influenza spreads easily, with rapid transmission in crowded areas including schools and nursing homes. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets containing viruses (infectious droplets) are dispersed into the air and can infect persons in close proximity. The virus can also be spread by hands contaminated with influenza viruses. To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and wash their hands regularly. In temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, while in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly.  The time from infection to illness, known as the incubation period, is about 2 days, but ranges from 1–4 days. Most cases of human influenza are clinically diagnosed. However, during periods of low influenza activity or outside of epidemics situations, the infection of other respiratory viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-2, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza and adenovirus) can also present as influenza-like illness (ILI), which makes the clinical differentiation of influenza from other pathogens difficult.  Collection of appropriate respiratory samples and the application of a laboratory diagnostic test is required to establish a definitive diagnosis. Proper collection, storage and transport of respiratory specimens is the essential first step for laboratory detection of influenza virus infections. Laboratory confirmation is commonly performed using direct antigen detection, virus isolation, or detection of influenza-specific RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Various guidance on the laboratory techniques is   published and updated by WHO . Rapid diagnostic tests are used in clinical settings, but they have lower sensitivity compared to RT-PCR methods and their reliability depends largely on the conditions under which they are used.  Most people will recover from influenza on their own. People with severe symptoms or other medical conditions should seek medical care. People with mild symptoms should: People at high risk or with severe symptoms should be treated with antiviral medications as soon as possible. They include people who are:  The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) monitors resistance to antivirals among circulating influenza viruses to provide timely evidence for national policies related to antiviral use.  Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza.  Safe and effective vaccines have been used for more than 60 years. Immunity from vaccination goes away over time so annual vaccination is recommended to protect against influenza.  The vaccine may be less effective in older people, but it will make the illness less severe and reduces the chance of complications and death.  Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk of influenza complications and their carers.  Annual vaccination is recommended for: Other ways to prevent influenza:  Vaccines are updated routinely with new vaccines developed that contain viruses that match those circulating. Several inactivated influenza vaccines and recombinant influenza vaccines are available in injectable form. Live attenuated influenza vaccines are available as a nasal spray.  WHO, through the Global Influenza Programme and GISRS, in collaboration with other partners, continuously monitors influenza viruses and activity globally, recommends seasonal influenza vaccine compositions twice a year for the northern and southern hemisphere influenza seasons, guides countries in tropical and subtropical areas as to which formulation vaccines to use, supports decisions for timing of vaccination campaigns, and supports Member States to develop prevention and control strategies.  WHO works to strengthen national, regional and global influenza response capacities including diagnostics, antiviral susceptibility monitoring, disease surveillance and outbreak response, to increase vaccine coverage among high-risk groups, and to support research and development of new therapeutics and other countermeasures.  1.  Estimates of US influenza-associated deaths made using four different methods.

Influenza A and B viruses circulate among humans and cause seasonal epidemics, although only type A viruses are known to have the potential to cause global pandemics based on current understanding. Wild aquatic birds are the primary natural reservoir for most subtypes of influenza A viruses. An influenza pandemic can start if a novel influenza A virus appears that people have little or no immunity to, and it spreads continuously between people. Influenza type A viruses are classified into subtypes according to the combinations of the proteins on the surface of the virus. When animal influenza viruses infect their host species, they are named according to the primary host – as avian influenza viruses, swine influenza viruses, equine influenza viruses, canine influenza viruses, etc. Avian influenza outbreaks in poultry can have immediate and severe consequences for the agricultural sector. Influenza C viruses are detected less frequently in humans and usually cause mild infection, and thus do not represent a major public health concern. Influenza D viruses primary affect cattle, although the virus does appear to have a broader host range. Influenza D viruses have some properties that suggest the potential to infect humans, but further studies are required to interpret current serologic and virologic data at the human-animal interface. Animal influenza viruses are distinct from human influenza viruses and do not easily transmit to and among humans. There will be influenza pandemics in the future, but when and with which virus, as well as where and how they will spread, is difficult to predict. They can have significant health, economic and social consequences. An influenza pandemic arises when an influenza virus emerges with the ability to cause sustained human-to-human transmission, and the human population has little to no immunity against the virus. Whether currently circulating avian, swine and other influenza viruses will result in a future pandemic is unknown. However, the diversity of zoonotic influenza viruses that have caused human infections necessitates strengthened surveillance in both animal and human populations, thorough investigation of every zoonotic infection and pandemic preparedness planning. Human infections with avian influenza viruses can cause illness ranging from mild, flu-like symptoms or eye inflammation (conjunctivitis) to severe, acute respiratory disease and death. Gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms have been reported infrequently. Disease severity depends upon many factors, including the virus causing the infection, the nature of exposure, clinical management, laboratory testing, and the characteristics of the infected individual. The reported case fatality rate for human infection with A(H5) and A(H7N9) viruses to date has been higher than that of seasonal influenza. The classification of low or high pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses (LPAI or HPAI) relates to disease presentation in chickens and is not related to disease in humans. Human infections with swine influenza viruses have generally been mild, with symptoms similar to those of human seasonal influenza – although in some cases, the patients needed hospitalization. Human infections with avian and other zoonotic influenza viruses, though rare, have been reported sporadically. Direct or indirect contact with infected animals represent the primary risk for human infection. Current zoonotic influenza viruses have not demonstrated sustained human-to-human transmission. For avian influenza viruses , the primary risk factor for human infection appears to be exposure to live or dead infected animals or contaminated environments, such as live bird markets. Handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing infected poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, are also risk factors. There have been reports of workers on animal farms contracting the virus after being exposed to infected animals and contaminated environments, especially during activities like culling or de-population. There is no evidence to suggest that A(H5), A(H7N9) or other avian influenza viruses can be transmitted to humans through properly prepared and cooked poultry or eggs. In 1997, human infections with A(H5N1), A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (Gs/Gd/96) lineage, viruses were reported during an outbreak in poultry in the Hong Kong special Administrative Region, China. Since 2003, these viruses have spread in bird populations from Asia to Europe and Africa, and to the Americas in 2021, and have caused recurrent epizootics in poultry populations in many countries. A(H5N1) viruses have caused hundreds of millions of poultry infections, outbreaks in wild birds, and have spread to some mammals (marine mammals, dairy cattle, and other wild and domestic animals). There have been hundreds of human cases, and many deaths, among people exposed to infected animals or contaminated environments. To date, A(H5N1) and other A(H5) avian influenza viruses have been found in birds or mammals on every continent except Oceania. Human cases have been reported from countries in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe, as well as in Oceania, where the case involved a person with a history of travel to another continent. In 2013, human infections with A(H7N9) viruses were reported for the first time in China. The virus spread in the poultry population across the country and resulted in over 1500 reported human cases and many human deaths from 2013 to 2019. No further human cases have been reported to WHO since 2019. In 2024, A(H5N1) viruses spread to dairy cattle in the United States of America and caused outbreaks. Some dairy farm workers who had direct contact with the infected cows were also infected. Other avian influenza viruses  have resulted in sporadic human infections. Since 1999, avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses have infected humans following exposure to infected birds but without further human-to-human spread. Human infections with A(H9N2) viruses continue to be detected as these avian influenza viruses are endemic in many poultry populations around the world. Since 2014, sporadic human infections with avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses have been reported – Mostly from China. Influenza A(H3N8), A(H5N2), A(H5N8), A(H6N1), A(H7N2), A(H7N3), A(H7N4), A(H7N7) and A(H10) viruses have also been associated with human infections.  For swine influenza viruses , risk factors for human infection include close proximity to infected pigs or visiting locations where pigs are exhibited. Sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses of the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes have been detected. Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection and testing should be done at a laboratory capable of safely processing and confirming zoonotic infections. Specialized reference laboratories take samples collected from suspected human cases to identify and analyse the virus. This process, done with speed and accuracy, is crucial for guiding a proper response. If a person is suspected of having zoonotic influenza, the health authorities should be notified and appropriate clinical management should be provided, including testing, triage, clinical assessment for disease severity classification, assessment of risk factors for severe disease, and isolation and treatment (for example, with antivirals and supportive care). Patients with influenza should be managed properly to prevent severe illness and death. Influenza viruses are unlikely to be eradicated and zoonotic infections will continue to occur. To minimize public health risk, quality surveillance in both animal and human populations, prompt and thorough investigation of every human infection and risk-based pandemic planning are essential. Public health and animal health authorities should work together and share information during investigations of human cases of zoonotic influenza. The public should strictly avoid contact with sick or dead animals, including wild birds, and should report dead animals or request their removal by contacting local wildlife or veterinary authorities. The public should minimize contact with animals in areas known to be affected by animal influenza viruses, including farms and settings where live animals may be sold or slaughtered, and avoid contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Everyone should clean their hands thoroughly and often, preferably washing their hands with soap and running water (especially if there is visible soiling of hands) or using alcohol hand rubs. This is especially important before and after contact with animals and their environments. Everyone should practice good food safety habits: properly handle, store and cook eggs, meat and other animal products, keep surfaces clean and wash hands, and only slaughter healthy animals for human consumption (animals that have unexpectedly died should not be consumed and should be disposed of appropriately in accordance with national regulations). Travelers to countries and people living in countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should, if possible, avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, and contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travelers returning from affected regions should report to local health services if they have respiratory symptoms and suspect zoonotic influenza virus infection. WHO continuously monitors avian and other zoonotic influenza viruses closely through its  Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) . WHO, in collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), conducts virus and disease surveillance at the human-animal interface, assesses the associated risks and coordinates response to zoonotic influenza outbreaks and other threats to public health. Twice a year, WHO consults with experts from WHO collaborating centres, Essential Regulatory Laboratories and other partners to review data generated by GISRS and animal health partners on influenza viruses with pandemic potential and assesses the need for additional candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes. Based on risk assessments, WHO provides guidance, develops and adjusts virus and disease surveillance, preparedness and response strategies to seasonal, zoonotic and pandemic influenza, and communicates timely risk assessment outcomes and intervention recommendations with Member States to enhance preparedness and response nationally and globally. The WHO  Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework  is to improve pandemic influenza preparedness and response, and strengthen the protection against the pandemic influenza by improving and strengthening the WHO GISRS.", "Overview": "There are 4 types of influenza viruses: A, B, C and D.

For avian influenza viruses , the primary risk factor for human infection appears to be exposure to live or dead infected animals or contaminated environments, such as live bird markets. Handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing infected poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, are also risk factors. There have been reports of workers on animal farms contracting the virus after being exposed to infected animals and contaminated environments, especially during activities like culling or de-population. There is no evidence to suggest that A(H5), A(H7N9) or other avian influenza viruses can be transmitted to humans through properly prepared and cooked poultry or eggs. In 1997, human infections with A(H5N1), A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (Gs/Gd/96) lineage, viruses were reported during an outbreak in poultry in the Hong Kong special Administrative Region, China. Since 2003, these viruses have spread in bird populations from Asia to Europe and Africa, and to the Americas in 2021, and have caused recurrent epizootics in poultry populations in many countries. A(H5N1) viruses have caused hundreds of millions of poultry infections, outbreaks in wild birds, and have spread to some mammals (marine mammals, dairy cattle, and other wild and domestic animals). There have been hundreds of human cases, and many deaths, among people exposed to infected animals or contaminated environments. To date, A(H5N1) and other A(H5) avian influenza viruses have been found in birds or mammals on every continent except Oceania. Human cases have been reported from countries in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe, as well as in Oceania, where the case involved a person with a history of travel to another continent. In 2013, human infections with A(H7N9) viruses were reported for the first time in China. The virus spread in the poultry population across the country and resulted in over 1500 reported human cases and many human deaths from 2013 to 2019. No further human cases have been reported to WHO since 2019. In 2024, A(H5N1) viruses spread to dairy cattle in the United States of America and caused outbreaks. Some dairy farm workers who had direct contact with the infected cows were also infected. Other avian influenza viruses  have resulted in sporadic human infections. Since 1999, avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses have infected humans following exposure to infected birds but without further human-to-human spread. Human infections with A(H9N2) viruses continue to be detected as these avian influenza viruses are endemic in many poultry populations around the world. Since 2014, sporadic human infections with avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses have been reported – Mostly from China. Influenza A(H3N8), A(H5N2), A(H5N8), A(H6N1), A(H7N2), A(H7N3), A(H7N4), A(H7N7) and A(H10) viruses have also been associated with human infections.  For swine influenza viruses , risk factors for human infection include close proximity to infected pigs or visiting locations where pigs are exhibited. Sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses of the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes have been detected. Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection and testing should be done at a laboratory capable of safely processing and confirming zoonotic infections. Specialized reference laboratories take samples collected from suspected human cases to identify and analyse the virus. This process, done with speed and accuracy, is crucial for guiding a proper response. If a person is suspected of having zoonotic influenza, the health authorities should be notified and appropriate clinical management should be provided, including testing, triage, clinical assessment for disease severity classification, assessment of risk factors for severe disease, and isolation and treatment (for example, with antivirals and supportive care). Patients with influenza should be managed properly to prevent severe illness and death. Influenza viruses are unlikely to be eradicated and zoonotic infections will continue to occur. To minimize public health risk, quality surveillance in both animal and human populations, prompt and thorough investigation of every human infection and risk-based pandemic planning are essential. Public health and animal health authorities should work together and share information during investigations of human cases of zoonotic influenza. The public should strictly avoid contact with sick or dead animals, including wild birds, and should report dead animals or request their removal by contacting local wildlife or veterinary authorities. The public should minimize contact with animals in areas known to be affected by animal influenza viruses, including farms and settings where live animals may be sold or slaughtered, and avoid contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Everyone should clean their hands thoroughly and often, preferably washing their hands with soap and running water (especially if there is visible soiling of hands) or using alcohol hand rubs. This is especially important before and after contact with animals and their environments. Everyone should practice good food safety habits: properly handle, store and cook eggs, meat and other animal products, keep surfaces clean and wash hands, and only slaughter healthy animals for human consumption (animals that have unexpectedly died should not be consumed and should be disposed of appropriately in accordance with national regulations). Travelers to countries and people living in countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should, if possible, avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, and contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travelers returning from affected regions should report to local health services if they have respiratory symptoms and suspect zoonotic influenza virus infection. WHO continuously monitors avian and other zoonotic influenza viruses closely through its  Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) . WHO, in collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), conducts virus and disease surveillance at the human-animal interface, assesses the associated risks and coordinates response to zoonotic influenza outbreaks and other threats to public health. Twice a year, WHO consults with experts from WHO collaborating centres, Essential Regulatory Laboratories and other partners to review data generated by GISRS and animal health partners on influenza viruses with pandemic potential and assesses the need for additional candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes. Based on risk assessments, WHO provides guidance, develops and adjusts virus and disease surveillance, preparedness and response strategies to seasonal, zoonotic and pandemic influenza, and communicates timely risk assessment outcomes and intervention recommendations with Member States to enhance preparedness and response nationally and globally.

{"title": "Hypertension", "summary": null, "sections": {"Risk factors": "Modifiable risk factors include unhealthy diets (excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese. In addition, there are environmental risk factors for hypertension and associated diseases, where air pollution is the most significant.   Non-modifiable risk factors include a family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease. Most people with hypertension don’t feel any symptoms. Very high blood pressures can cause headaches, blurred vision, chest pain and other symptoms.  Checking your blood pressure is the best way to know if you have high blood pressure. If hypertension isn’t treated, it can cause other health conditions like kidney disease, heart disease and stroke.  People with very high blood pressure (usually 180/120 or higher) can experience symptoms including: If you are experiencing any of these symptoms and a high blood pressure, seek care immediately. The only way to detect hypertension is to have a health professional measure blood pressure. Having blood pressure measured is quick and painless. Although individuals can measure their own blood pressure using automated devices, an evaluation by a health professional is important for assessment of risk and associated conditions. Lifestyle changes can help lower high blood pressure. These include: If you have high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend one or more medicines. Your recommended blood pressure goal may depend on what other health conditions you have.  Blood pressure goal is less than 130/80 if you have: For most people, the goal is to have a blood pressure less than 140/90.  There are several common blood pressure medicines:  Lifestyle changes can help lower high blood pressure and can help anyone with hypertension. Many who make these changes will still need to take medicine.  These lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure.  Do:\r\n Don’t: Reducing hypertension prevents heart attack, stroke and kidney damage, as well as other health problems.  Reduce the risks of hypertension by:  Among other complications, hypertension can cause serious damage to the heart. Excessive pressure can harden arteries, decreasing the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart. This elevated pressure and reduced blood flow can cause:  Hypertension can also burst or block arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain, causing a stroke. In addition, hypertension can cause kidney damage, leading to kidney failure. The prevalence of hypertension varies across regions and country income groups. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region has the highest prevalence of hypertension (38%) while the WHO Western Pacific Region has the lowest prevalence of hypertension (29%).  The number of adults with hypertension increased from 650 million in 1990 to 1.4 billion in 2024, with the increase seen largely in low- and middle-income countries. This increase is due mainly to a rise in the number of older adults in those countries.  The World Health Organization (WHO) supports countries to reduce hypertension as a public health problem. In 2021, WHO released a  new guideline for on the pharmacological treatment of hypertension  in adults. The publication provides evidence-based recommendations for the initiation of treatment of hypertension, and recommended intervals for follow-up. The document also includes target blood pressure to be achieved for control, and information on who, in the health-care system, can initiate treatment.  To support governments in strengthening the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease, WHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) launched the  Global Hearts Initiative  in September 2016, which includes the HEARTS technical package. The six modules of the  HEARTS technical package  (Healthy-lifestyle counselling, Evidence-based treatment protocols, Access to essential medicines and technology, Risk-based management, Team-based care, and Systems for monitoring) provide a strategic approach to improve cardiovascular health in countries across the world.

{"title": "Human T-lymphotropic virus-1", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus which causes a chronic lifelong infection in humans. Its transmission happens through breast feeding, sexual contact, needle sharing and unsafe blood transfusions. It causes a range of clinical manifestations including poor functioning immune system (immunosuppression), inflammation of the eye (uveitis) and skin (dermatitis), and pneumonia (pneumonitis). HTLV-1 may lead to cancer in some people (adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma) and various neurological complications such as myelopathy (HTLV-1 associated myelopathy, also called spastic paraparesis).  HTLV-1 is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, breastfeeding, needle sharing and unsafe blood transfusion. Mother-to-child transmission occurs primarily through breastfeeding at a rate of around 20–30%, with shorter durations of breastfeeding associated with lower rates of transmission.  Women are more frequently affected by HTLV than men for reasons that are not well-understood. This might reflect higher efficiency of male to female transmission but could also be due to other biological factors. HTLV-1 has been detected in cervical secretions and semen, but higher lymphocyte counts may be present in the semen enhancing transmission.  Transfusion of cellular blood products from a person with HTLV-1 infection carries a high risk of transmission, as does solid organ transplantation. However, transfusion of cell-free plasma carries a low or no risk of transmission.  HTLV-1 can be transmitted through needle sharing, which poses a significant risk for spreading the infection. Sharing needles is a common route of transmission for HTLV-1, especially among people who inject drugs. To reduce the risk of HTLV-1 transmission, it is crucial to avoid sharing needles and to adhere to safe injection practices. Diagnosing HTLV-1 can be challenging. The diagnosis of HTLV-1 infection is usually made by testing for HTLV-1 antibodies in blood samples using enzyme-linked immunoassay. No single test can provide a definitive HTLV-1 diagnosis. A combination of tests is needed. The second test may detect antibodies to different HTLV-1 proteins (for example, western blotting and line immunoassay) or may detect proviral DNA integrated into the host cell genome (using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)). This combined approach is important to confirm HTLV-1 infection and to differentiate between HTLV-1 and other less common and less pathogenic types of HTLV, e.g. HTLV-2. PCR detects or quantifies HTLV-1 proviral DNA integrated into the host cell genome. Cell free virus is rarely found in plasma of people living with the virus. Therefore, detection of HTLV-1 RNA is not used for diagnostics. Most people with HTLV-1 infection do not have symptoms. About 5–10% of people with HTLV-1 will develop a recognized associated clinical condition, namely HAM and ATL. Other clinical manifestations may be uveitis, dermatitis and pneumonitis.  HTLV-1 can cause a form of blood cancer called adult T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma. People may present with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, hypercalcaemia through involvement of the skin, lung, bones and other organs. HTLV-1 can also cause a progressive disease of the nervous system called either HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (HAM) or tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). This is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, characterized by progressive spastic weakness of the lower limbs, lower back pain and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Clinical findings can include muscle weakness, hyperreflexia and clonus in the lower limbs, along with extensor plantar response and a spastic gait. The lifetime risk among people with HTLV-1 infection of developing ATL is estimated at 5% and of HAM/TSP at 2%.  Public health strategies and interventions that could prevent HTLV-1 transmission include: It is important to increase public awareness to support these interventions and to ensure diagnostic capacity is available in high-prevalence settings to screen and diagnose people living with HTLV-1. There is currently no vaccine for HTLV-1, although development of a vaccine is considered feasible. No candidate HTLV-1 vaccine has proceeded to a clinical trial with an efficacy endpoint so far. There is currently no treatment for HTLV-1 infection. Treatment focuses on managing associated conditions and includes corticosteroids, immune modulating drugs, chemotherapy and transplantation. In collaboration with Member States and partners, WHO works to develop guidance on HTLV-1 surveillance methods, including methods to determine prevalence and methods for monitoring interventions. This includes rapid assessment methods and burden of disease estimates. Specific guidance is also needed for low-resource settings on testing approaches and strategies for HTLV-1 detection that are appropriate to the setting and the purpose. Further testing and analysis will determine whether there is a level of proviral load below which transmission risk is negligible, as well as specific data to better define the risk of mother-to-child HTLV-1 transmission and the effectiveness of prevention strategies.  WHO is currently developing the first guideline to incorporate the latest evidence and good practices on addressing testing for and prevention of HTLV-1.

{"title": "Human papillomavirus and cancer", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection. Almost all sexually active people will be infected at some point in their lives, usually without symptoms. HPV can affect the skin, genital area and throat.  Condoms help prevent HPV but do not offer total protection because they do not cover all the genital skin. HPV usually goes away on its own without treatment. Some HPV infections cause genital warts. Others can cause abnormal cells to develop, which go on to become cancer. Cancers from HPV can be prevented with vaccines. The vaccine does not contain any live virus or DNA from the virus so it cannot cause cancer or other HPV-related illnesses. The HPV vaccine is not used to treat HPV infections or diseases caused by HPV, but instead to prevent the development of cancers. Currently, cervical cancer is the only HPV-caused cancer for which screening tests are available. Screening tests are used to check for disease when there are no symptoms. The goal of screening for cervical cancer is to find precancerous cell changes before they become cancer and when treatment can prevent cancer from developing. Screening for cervical cancer is an important part of routine health care for people who have a cervix. This includes women and transgender men who still have a cervix.  Cervical cancer is the most common type of cancer caused by HPV, other less common cancers affecting men and women, including anal, vulvar, vaginal, mouth/throat and penile cancers.  The highest prevalence of cervical HPV among women is in sub-Saharan Africa (24%), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (16%), eastern Europe (14%), and South-East Asia (14%)  (2) . Prevalence in men is highly variable based on sexual trends. Evidence showed  that prevalence of the virus is higher among women living with HIV, men who have sex with men, immunocompromised individuals, people with co-infection with other sexually transmitted infections (STI), people who receive immunosuppressive medications and children who have been through sexual abuse. Globally, it is estimated that 620 000 new cancer cases in women and 70 000 new cancer cases in men were caused by HPV in 2019  (1) . Cervical cancer was the fourth leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in women in 2022, with some 660 000 new cases and around 350 000 deaths worldwide  (3) . Cervical cancers account for over 90% of HPV-related cancers in women  (1) .  The highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are in low- and middle-income countries. This reflects major inequities driven by lack of access to national HPV vaccination, cervical screening and treatment services, and social and economic determinants. Most people will not have any symptoms from an HPV infection. The immune system usually clears HPV from the body within a year or two with no lasting effects. Some HPV infections cause small rough lumps (genital warts) that can appear on the vagina, penis or anus and rarely the throat. They may be painful, itchy or bleed or cause swollen glands. HPV infection that does not go away on its own can cause changes to cervical cells, which lead to precancers that may become cervical cancer if left untreated. It usually takes 15–20 years for cervical cancer to develop after HPV infection. The early changes in cervical cells and precancers mostly do not cause symptoms. Symptoms of cervical cancer may include bleeding between periods or after sexual intercourse or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge. These symptoms may be due to other diseases. People with these symptoms should speak to their healthcare provider. Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent HPV infection, cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers. Screening can detect cervical precancers that can be treated before they develop into cancer. HPV vaccines should be given to all girls aged 9–14 years, before they become sexually active. The vaccine may be given as 1 or 2 doses. People with reduced immune systems should receive 2 or 3 doses. Check with your healthcare provider to determine what is best for you. Using condoms during sex is an important way to prevent HPV infection. Voluntary male circumcision also reduces the risk of infection. Being a non-smoker or stopping smoking reduces the chances of developing persistent HPV infection. Testing cells from a woman’s cervix for HPV is used to screen women for cervical cancer. Women should be screened every 5–10 years starting at age 30. Women living with HIV should be screened every 3 years starting at age 25. After a positive HPV test (or other screening method), a healthcare provider can look for changes on the cervix or precancers that could develop into cervical cancer if left untreated. Treatment of precancers prevents cervical cancer. Precancers rarely cause symptoms, which is why regular screening to check cervical health is important. Learn more about vaccination of boys and older age groups:  WHO position paper There is currently no treatment for HPV infection. Treatments exist for genital warts, cervical precancers and cervical cancer. Non-cancerous genital warts and precancerous lesions in the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus or penis can be removed or treated by ablation (freezing or heating) or with surgery. Currently, cancer of the cervix (cervical cancer) is the only HPV-caused cancer for which screening tests are available. Treatments for cancers caused by HPV (including cervical cancer) are more effective if diagnosed early. Treatment should begin quickly after diagnosis. Learn more about cervical precancer treatment here:  WHO fact sheet on cervical cancer Management pathways for invasive cancer care are important tools to ensure that a patient is referred promptly and supported as they navigate the steps to diagnosis and treatment decisions. A multidisciplinary team should ensure diagnosis and staging (histological testing, pathology, imaging) takes place prior to treatment decisions which could include surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy such as chemotherapy. Treatment decisions should be in line with national guidelines and interventions should be supported by holistic psychological, spiritual, physical and palliative care.  As low- and middle-income countries scale-up cervical screening, more cases of invasive cervical cancer will be detected, especially in previously unscreened populations. Therefore, referral and treatment strategies need to be implemented and expanded alongside prevention services.  Giving the global public health burden of cervical cancer caused by HPV, the World Health Assembly (WHA. 73.2) adopted the  Global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem   with the following targets:  Prevention of HPV-associated precancer and cancer is also a key element of WHO’s  Global health sector strategy on, respectively, HIV,   hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections, 2022 – 2030   and the resolution WHA74.5 (2021) on oral health includes actions on mouth/throat cancers.

Evidence showed  that prevalence of the virus is higher among women living with HIV, men who have sex with men, immunocompromised individuals, people with co-infection with other sexually transmitted infections (STI), people who receive immunosuppressive medications and children who have been through sexual abuse. Globally, it is estimated that 620 000 new cancer cases in women and 70 000 new cancer cases in men were caused by HPV in 2019  (1) . Cervical cancer was the fourth leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in women in 2022, with some 660 000 new cases and around 350 000 deaths worldwide  (3) . Cervical cancers account for over 90% of HPV-related cancers in women  (1) .  The highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are in low- and middle-income countries. This reflects major inequities driven by lack of access to national HPV vaccination, cervical screening and treatment services, and social and economic determinants. Most people will not have any symptoms from an HPV infection. The immune system usually clears HPV from the body within a year or two with no lasting effects. Some HPV infections cause small rough lumps (genital warts) that can appear on the vagina, penis or anus and rarely the throat. They may be painful, itchy or bleed or cause swollen glands. HPV infection that does not go away on its own can cause changes to cervical cells, which lead to precancers that may become cervical cancer if left untreated. It usually takes 15–20 years for cervical cancer to develop after HPV infection. The early changes in cervical cells and precancers mostly do not cause symptoms. Symptoms of cervical cancer may include bleeding between periods or after sexual intercourse or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge. These symptoms may be due to other diseases. People with these symptoms should speak to their healthcare provider. Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent HPV infection, cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers. Screening can detect cervical precancers that can be treated before they develop into cancer. HPV vaccines should be given to all girls aged 9–14 years, before they become sexually active. The vaccine may be given as 1 or 2 doses. People with reduced immune systems should receive 2 or 3 doses. Check with your healthcare provider to determine what is best for you. Using condoms during sex is an important way to prevent HPV infection. Voluntary male circumcision also reduces the risk of infection. Being a non-smoker or stopping smoking reduces the chances of developing persistent HPV infection. Testing cells from a woman’s cervix for HPV is used to screen women for cervical cancer. Women should be screened every 5–10 years starting at age 30. Women living with HIV should be screened every 3 years starting at age 25. After a positive HPV test (or other screening method), a healthcare provider can look for changes on the cervix or precancers that could develop into cervical cancer if left untreated. Treatment of precancers prevents cervical cancer. Precancers rarely cause symptoms, which is why regular screening to check cervical health is important.

Treatments exist for genital warts, cervical precancers and cervical cancer. Non-cancerous genital warts and precancerous lesions in the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus or penis can be removed or treated by ablation (freezing or heating) or with surgery. Currently, cancer of the cervix (cervical cancer) is the only HPV-caused cancer for which screening tests are available. Treatments for cancers caused by HPV (including cervical cancer) are more effective if diagnosed early. Treatment should begin quickly after diagnosis.

A multidisciplinary team should ensure diagnosis and staging (histological testing, pathology, imaging) takes place prior to treatment decisions which could include surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy such as chemotherapy.

{"title": "HIV and AIDS", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) occurs at the most advanced stage of infection. HIV targets the body’s white blood cells, weakening the immune system. This makes it easier to get sick with diseases like tuberculosis, infections and some cancers. HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. It can also spread from a mother to her baby. HIV can be prevented and treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Untreated HIV can progress to AIDS, often after many years. WHO now defines Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) as CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO stage 3 or 4 event in adults and adolescents. All children younger than 5 years of age living with HIV are considered to have advanced HIV disease, regardless of clinical or immunological status.  The signs and symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. HIV spreads more easily in the first few months after a person is infected, but many are unaware of their status until the later stages. In the first few weeks after being infected people may not experience symptoms. Others may have an influenza-like illness including: The infection progressively weakens the immune system. This can cause other signs and symptoms: Without treatment, people living with HIV infection can also develop severe illnesses: HIV can make other infections, such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B and mpox, get worse. HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of body fluids from people living with HIV, including blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions. HIV can also be transmitted to a child during pregnancy and delivery.  People cannot become infected with HIV through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water. People living with HIV who are taking ART and have an undetectable viral load will not transmit HIV to their sexual partners. Early access to ART and support to remain on treatment is therefore critical not only to improve the health of people living with HIV but also to prevent HIV transmission. Behaviours and conditions that put people at greater risk of contracting HIV include: HIV can be diagnosed  through rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results. This greatly facilitates early diagnosis and linkage with treatment and prevention. People can also use HIV self-tests to test themselves. However, no single test can provide a full HIV positive diagnosis; confirmatory testing is required, conducted by a qualified and trained health worker or community worker. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and algorithm. Most widely used HIV diagnostic tests detect antibodies produced by a person as part of their immune response to fight HIV. In most cases, people develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection. During this time, people are in the so-called “window period” when they have low levels of antibodies which cannot be detected by many rapid tests, but they may still transmit HIV to others. People who have had a recent high-risk exposure and test negative can have a further test after 28 days. Following a positive diagnosis, people should be retested before they are enrolled in treatment and care to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. While testing for adolescents and adults has been made simple and efficient, this is not the case for babies born to HIV-positive mothers. For children less than 18 months of age, rapid antibody testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection – virological testing must be provided as early as birth or at 6 weeks of age. New technologies are now available to perform this test at the point of care and enable same-day results, which will accelerate appropriate linkage with treatment and care. HIV is a preventable disease. The risk of HIV infection can be reduced by: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an additional prevention option. It is an antiretroviral medication used by HIV-negative people to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. WHO recommends the following PrEP methods :   ARVs can also be used to prevent mothers from passing HIV to their children. People taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not pass HIV to their sexual partners. Access to testing and ART is an important part of preventing HIV. When given before possible exposures to HIV it is called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and when given after an exposure it is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).  People can use PrEP or PEP when the risk of contracting HIV is high; people should seek advice from a clinician when thinking about using PrEP or PEP. There is no cure for HIV infection. It is treated with antiretroviral drugs, which stop the virus from replicating in the body. Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but allows a person’s immune system to get stronger. This helps them to fight other infections. Currently, ART must be taken every day for the rest of a person’s life. ART lowers the amount of the virus in a person’s body. This stops symptoms and allows people to live full and healthy lives. People living with HIV who are taking ART and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not spread the virus to their sexual partners. Pregnant women with HIV should have access to, and take, ART as soon as possible. This protects the health of the mother and will help prevent HIV transmission to the fetus before birth, or through breast milk. Advanced HIV disease remains a persistent problem in the HIV response. WHO is supporting countries to implement the advanced HIV disease package of care to reduce illness and death. Newer HIV medicines and short course treatments for opportunistic infections like cryptococcal meningitis are being developed that may change the way people take ART and prevention medicines, including access to long-acting injectable formulations, such as lenacapavir which now has been approved by the FDA for HIV prevention.

HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and algorithm. Most widely used HIV diagnostic tests detect antibodies produced by a person as part of their immune response to fight HIV. In most cases, people develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection. During this time, people are in the so-called “window period” when they have low levels of antibodies which cannot be detected by many rapid tests, but they may still transmit HIV to others. People who have had a recent high-risk exposure and test negative can have a further test after 28 days. Following a positive diagnosis, people should be retested before they are enrolled in treatment and care to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. While testing for adolescents and adults has been made simple and efficient, this is not the case for babies born to HIV-positive mothers. For children less than 18 months of age, rapid antibody testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection – virological testing must be provided as early as birth or at 6 weeks of age. New technologies are now available to perform this test at the point of care and enable same-day results, which will accelerate appropriate linkage with treatment and care. HIV is a preventable disease. The risk of HIV infection can be reduced by: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an additional prevention option. It is an antiretroviral medication used by HIV-negative people to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. WHO recommends the following PrEP methods :   ARVs can also be used to prevent mothers from passing HIV to their children. People taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not pass HIV to their sexual partners. Access to testing and ART is an important part of preventing HIV. When given before possible exposures to HIV it is called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and when given after an exposure it is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).  People can use PrEP or PEP when the risk of contracting HIV is high; people should seek advice from a clinician when thinking about using PrEP or PEP. There is no cure for HIV infection. It is treated with antiretroviral drugs, which stop the virus from replicating in the body. Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but allows a person’s immune system to get stronger. This helps them to fight other infections. Currently, ART must be taken every day for the rest of a person’s life. ART lowers the amount of the virus in a person’s body. This stops symptoms and allows people to live full and healthy lives. People living with HIV who are taking ART and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not spread the virus to their sexual partners. Pregnant women with HIV should have access to, and take, ART as soon as possible. This protects the health of the mother and will help prevent HIV transmission to the fetus before birth, or through breast milk. Advanced HIV disease remains a persistent problem in the HIV response. WHO is supporting countries to implement the advanced HIV disease package of care to reduce illness and death. Newer HIV medicines and short course treatments for opportunistic infections like cryptococcal meningitis are being developed that may change the way people take ART and prevention medicines, including access to long-acting injectable formulations, such as lenacapavir which now has been approved by the FDA for HIV prevention.

HIV can also be transmitted to a child during pregnancy and delivery.  People cannot become infected with HIV through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water. People living with HIV who are taking ART and have an undetectable viral load will not transmit HIV to their sexual partners. Early access to ART and support to remain on treatment is therefore critical not only to improve the health of people living with HIV but also to prevent HIV transmission.

{"title": "Herpes simplex virus", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV), known as herpes, is a common infection that can cause painful blisters or ulcers. It primarily spreads by skin-to-skin contact. It is treatable but not curable. There are two types of herpes simplex virus.  Type 1 (HSV-1) mostly spreads by oral contact and causes infections in or around the mouth (oral herpes or cold sores). It can also cause genital herpes. Most adults are infected with HSV-1.  Type 2 (HSV-2) spreads by sexual contact and causes genital herpes.  Most people have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. The infection can cause painful blisters or ulcers that can recur over time. Medicines can reduce symptoms but can’t cure the infection.  Recurrent symptoms of both oral and genital herpes may be distressing. Genital herpes may also be stigmatizing and have an impact on sexual relationships. Most people with herpes have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. Many people aren’t aware they have the infection and can pass along the virus to others without knowing. Symptoms can include painful, recurring blisters or ulcers. New infections may cause fever, body aches and swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms may be different during the first episode (or ‘outbreak’) of infection than during a recurrent episode. If symptoms occur, they often begin with tingling, itching or burning near where the sores will appear.  Common oral herpes symptoms include blisters (cold sores) or open sores (ulcers) in or around the mouth or lips. Common genital herpes symptoms include bumps, blisters, or open sores (ulcers) around the genitals or anus. These sores and blisters are typically painful. Blisters may break open, ooze and then crust over.  During their first infection, people may experience:  People can have repeated outbreaks over time (‘recurrences’). These are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Medicines are often used to treat first or recurrent symptomatic episodes (outbreaks) of herpes. They can decrease how long symptoms last and how severe they are, but they can’t cure the infection. Treatment for recurrent episodes is most effective when started within 48 hours of when symptoms begin.  Antiviral medicines commonly given include acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir. Taking a lower dose of one of these medicines every day (suppressive therapy) can also decrease how often symptoms occur. Daily treatment is often recommended for people who get very painful or frequent recurrent episodes or who want to lower the risk of giving herpes to someone else. Medicines to help with pain related to sores include paracetamol (acetaminophen), naproxen or ibuprofen. Medicines that can be applied to numb the affected area include benzocaine and lidocaine. Herpes simplex virus lives inside of nerve cells and alternates between being inactive and active. Certain triggers can reactivate the virus including: For people whose oral herpes is activated by sunlight, avoiding sun exposure and wearing sunscreen can lower the risk of recurrences.  To decrease symptoms of oral herpes, people can:  For genital herpes, people can: There are ways to lower the risk of spreading herpes including: Talk to your healthcare provider if you are pregnant, because there is a risk of passing herpes to your baby.  In 2020 (last available estimates), 3.8 billion people under the age of 50, or 64% of the global population, had HSV-1 infection (oral or genital). Most HSV-1 infections are acquired during childhood to cause oral herpes. Around 10% of these (376 million) were estimated to be genital infections occurring in 15–49-year-olds. Genital herpes caused by HSV-2 affects an estimated 520 million (13%) people aged 15–49 years worldwide (2020 data). HSV-2 infects women almost twice as often as men because sexual transmission is more efficient from men to women. Prevalence increases with age, though the highest number of new infections are in adolescents and young adults. An estimated 205 million people aged 15–49 (5.3%) experienced at least one symptomatic episode of genital herpes in 2020. The majority of these people (92%) had symptoms related to HSV-2 infection. HSV-2 is much more likely than genital HSV-1 infection to cause recurrent symptoms. HSV-1 is mainly transmitted via contact with the virus in sores, saliva or skin surfaces in or around the mouth. Less commonly, HSV-1 can be transmitted to the genital area through oral-genital contact to cause genital herpes. It can be transmitted from oral or skin surfaces that appear normal; however, the greatest risk of transmission is when there are active sores. People who already have HSV-1 are not at risk of reinfection with HSV-1, but they are still at risk of acquiring HSV-2. HSV-2 is mainly transmitted during sex through contact with genital or anal surfaces, skin, sores or fluids of someone infected with the virus. HSV-2 can be transmitted even if the skin looks normal and is often transmitted in the absence of symptoms.  In rare circumstances, herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2) can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery, causing neonatal herpes. HSV-2 infection increases the risk of acquiring HIV infection by approximately three-fold. Additionally, people with both HIV and HSV-2 infection are more likely to spread HIV to others. HSV-2 infection is among the most common infections in people living with HIV. In immunocompromised people, including those with advanced HIV infection, herpes can have more severe symptoms and more frequent recurrences. Rare complications of HSV-2 include meningoencephalitis (brain infection) and disseminated infection. Rarely, HSV-1 infection can lead to more severe complications such as encephalitis (brain infection) or keratitis (eye infection). Neonatal herpes can occur when an infant is exposed to HSV during delivery. Neonatal herpes is rare, occurring in an estimated 10 out of every 100 000 births globally. However, it is a serious condition that can lead to lasting neurologic disability or death. The risk for neonatal herpes is greatest when a mother acquires HSV for the first time in late pregnancy. People with symptoms of oral herpes should avoid oral contact with others (including oral sex) and sharing objects that touched saliva. Individuals with symptoms of genital herpes should abstain from sexual activity while experiencing symptoms. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are most contagious when sores are present but can also be transmitted when no symptoms are felt or visible. For sexually active people, consistent and correct use of condoms is the best way to prevent genital herpes and other STIs. Condoms reduce the risk; however, HSV infection can still occur through contact with genital or anal areas not covered by the condom. Medical male circumcision can provide life-long partial protection against HSV-2 infection, as well as against HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV).  People with symptoms suggestive of genital herpes should be offered HIV testing. Pregnant women with symptoms of genital herpes should inform their health care providers. Preventing acquisition of HSV-2 infection is particularly important for women in late pregnancy when the risk for neonatal herpes is greatest.  WHO is working to increase awareness about HSV infection and its symptoms, improve access to antiviral medications, and promote HIV prevention efforts for those with genital herpes, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).  WHO and partners are also supporting research to develop new strategies for prevention and control of HSV infections, such as vaccines and topical microbicides.   References", "Overview": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV), known as herpes, is a common infection that can cause painful blisters or ulcers.

Less commonly, HSV-1 can be transmitted to the genital area through oral-genital contact to cause genital herpes. It can be transmitted from oral or skin surfaces that appear normal; however, the greatest risk of transmission is when there are active sores. People who already have HSV-1 are not at risk of reinfection with HSV-1, but they are still at risk of acquiring HSV-2. HSV-2 is mainly transmitted during sex through contact with genital or anal surfaces, skin, sores or fluids of someone infected with the virus. HSV-2 can be transmitted even if the skin looks normal and is often transmitted in the absence of symptoms.  In rare circumstances, herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2) can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery, causing neonatal herpes. HSV-2 infection increases the risk of acquiring HIV infection by approximately three-fold. Additionally, people with both HIV and HSV-2 infection are more likely to spread HIV to others. HSV-2 infection is among the most common infections in people living with HIV. In immunocompromised people, including those with advanced HIV infection, herpes can have more severe symptoms and more frequent recurrences. Rare complications of HSV-2 include meningoencephalitis (brain infection) and disseminated infection. Rarely, HSV-1 infection can lead to more severe complications such as encephalitis (brain infection) or keratitis (eye infection). Neonatal herpes can occur when an infant is exposed to HSV during delivery. Neonatal herpes is rare, occurring in an estimated 10 out of every 100 000 births globally. However, it is a serious condition that can lead to lasting neurologic disability or death. The risk for neonatal herpes is greatest when a mother acquires HSV for the first time in late pregnancy. People with symptoms of oral herpes should avoid oral contact with others (including oral sex) and sharing objects that touched saliva. Individuals with symptoms of genital herpes should abstain from sexual activity while experiencing symptoms. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are most contagious when sores are present but can also be transmitted when no symptoms are felt or visible. For sexually active people, consistent and correct use of condoms is the best way to prevent genital herpes and other STIs. Condoms reduce the risk; however, HSV infection can still occur through contact with genital or anal areas not covered by the condom. Medical male circumcision can provide life-long partial protection against HSV-2 infection, as well as against HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV).  People with symptoms suggestive of genital herpes should be offered HIV testing. Pregnant women with symptoms of genital herpes should inform their health care providers. Preventing acquisition of HSV-2 infection is particularly important for women in late pregnancy when the risk for neonatal herpes is greatest.  WHO is working to increase awareness about HSV infection and its symptoms, improve access to antiviral medications, and promote HIV prevention efforts for those with genital herpes, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).  WHO and partners are also supporting research to develop new strategies for prevention and control of HSV infections, such as vaccines and topical microbicides.   References", "Symptoms": "Most people with herpes have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. Many people aren’t aware they have the infection and can pass along the virus to others without knowing. Symptoms can include painful, recurring blisters or ulcers. New infections may cause fever, body aches and swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms may be different during the first episode (or ‘outbreak’) of infection than during a recurrent episode. If symptoms occur, they often begin with tingling, itching or burning near where the sores will appear.  Common oral herpes symptoms include blisters (cold sores) or open sores (ulcers) in or around the mouth or lips. Common genital herpes symptoms include bumps, blisters, or open sores (ulcers) around the genitals or anus. These sores and blisters are typically painful. Blisters may break open, ooze and then crust over.  During their first infection, people may experience:  People can have repeated outbreaks over time (‘recurrences’). These are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Medicines are often used to treat first or recurrent symptomatic episodes (outbreaks) of herpes. They can decrease how long symptoms last and how severe they are, but they can’t cure the infection. Treatment for recurrent episodes is most effective when started within 48 hours of when symptoms begin.  Antiviral medicines commonly given include acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir. Taking a lower dose of one of these medicines every day (suppressive therapy) can also decrease how often symptoms occur. Daily treatment is often recommended for people who get very painful or frequent recurrent episodes or who want to lower the risk of giving herpes to someone else. Medicines to help with pain related to sores include paracetamol (acetaminophen), naproxen or ibuprofen. Medicines that can be applied to numb the affected area include benzocaine and lidocaine. Herpes simplex virus lives inside of nerve cells and alternates between being inactive and active. Certain triggers can reactivate the virus including: For people whose oral herpes is activated by sunlight, avoiding sun exposure and wearing sunscreen can lower the risk of recurrences.  To decrease symptoms of oral herpes, people can:  For genital herpes, people can: There are ways to lower the risk of spreading herpes including: Talk to your healthcare provider if you are pregnant, because there is a risk of passing herpes to your baby.  In 2020 (last available estimates), 3.8 billion people under the age of 50, or 64% of the global population, had HSV-1 infection (oral or genital). Most HSV-1 infections are acquired during childhood to cause oral herpes. Around 10% of these (376 million) were estimated to be genital infections occurring in 15–49-year-olds. Genital herpes caused by HSV-2 affects an estimated 520 million (13%) people aged 15–49 years worldwide (2020 data). HSV-2 infects women almost twice as often as men because sexual transmission is more efficient from men to women. Prevalence increases with age, though the highest number of new infections are in adolescents and young adults.

{"title": "Hepatitis E", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Hepatitis E is inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). The virus is shed in the stools of infected people and enters the human body through the oral route. It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. The infection is usually self-limiting and resolves within 2–6 weeks. A serious disease known as fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) occasionally develops, which can be fatal. Hepatitis E infection is found worldwide and is common in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene and health services. Infection can occur as outbreaks or as sporadic cases. HEV has four major genotypes that cause human disease (genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4). The genotypes have distinct routes of transmission and geographical distributions. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 primarily infect humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 mainly infect non-human mammals and cause occasional zoonotic disease in humans. The transmission of genotypes 3 and 4 is mainly zoonotic, through consumption of uncooked or undercooked meat, with the environment also a likely source of infection.  Genotype 1 and 2, the most prevalent HEV genotypes in Africa and parts of Asia, are mainly faecal-orally transmitted. In particular contamination of drinking water often leads to large-scale outbreaks, affecting several hundred to several thousand people. Some of these outbreaks have occurred in areas of conflict and humanitarian emergencies such as war zones and camps for refugees or internally displaced populations, where sanitation and safe water supply pose special challenges.  The incubation period following exposure to HEV ranges from 2 to 10 weeks, with an average of 5 to 6 weeks. The infected persons excretes the virus beginning from a few days before to 3–4 weeks after onset of the disease. In areas with high disease endemicity, symptomatic infection is most common in young adults aged 15–40 years. In these areas, although infection does occur in children, it often goes undiagnosed because they typically have no symptoms or only a mild illness without jaundice. Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include: These symptoms may be indistinguishable from those experienced during other forms of hepatitis or other infectious diseases in endemic areas, such as leptospirosis, dengue, yellow fever and malaria. The symptoms typically last 1–6 weeks. Although hepatitis E is commonly considered as an acute, self-limited disease, in rare cases acute hepatitis E can be severe and result in fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure). These patients are at risk of death. Pregnant women with hepatitis E, particularly those in the second or third trimester, are at increased risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss and mortality. Up to 20–25% of pregnant women can die if they get hepatitis E in third trimester. Rarely, cases of chronic hepatitis E infection have as well been reported in immunosuppressed people, particularly organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive drugs.  Cases of hepatitis E are not clinically distinguishable from other types of acute viral hepatitis or potentially other infectious disease that cause jaundice. However, diagnosis can often be strongly suspected in appropriate epidemiologic settings, for example when several cases occur in localities in known disease-endemic areas, in settings with risk of water contamination when the disease is more severe in pregnant women or if hepatitis A has been excluded. Definitive diagnosis of hepatitis E infection is usually based on the detection of specific anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the virus in a person’s blood. Rapid tests are available for field use. Other laboratory findings include elevated serum concentrations of bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Additional tests include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the hepatitis E virus RNA in blood and stool. This assay requires specialized laboratory facilities. This test is particularly needed in areas where hepatitis E is infrequent and in uncommon cases with chronic HEV infection. There is no specific antiviral treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis E. As the disease is usually self-limiting, hospitalization is generally not required. It is important to avoid unnecessary medications that can adversely affect liver function, for example acetaminophen (paracetamol). Hospitalization is required for people with fulminant hepatitis and should also be considered for symptomatic pregnant women. Prevention is the most effective approach against the infection. It is particularly important to guarantee that exposed pregnant women have access to appropriate information and prevention measures. At the population level, transmission of HEV and hepatitis E infection can be reduced by: On an individual level, infection risk can be reduced by: HEV prevention and disease control therefore primarily rely on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) measures which are often inadequately implemented in settings which would benefit most.  Additionally, the development of the only currently available Hepatitis E vaccine, known as HEV 239 vaccine (Hecolin®), marks an opportunity to protect vulnerable populations and curb disease outbreaks.  The vaccine has been licensed for use in healthy adults aged  ≥ 16 years in China since 2011 via intramuscular injection using a 3-dose schedule (0, 1 and 6 months). The product is supplied in a pre-filled syringe with an approved shelf life of at least 36 months. In a large, phase III clinical trial in China, it exhibited a high efficacy rate and exhibited a good safety profile, notably in adults aged ≥16 year In March 2022, a significant milestone in the field of hepatitis E vaccination was achieved on the African continent. In response to the hepatitis E outbreak in Bentiu, South Sudan, Médecins Sans Frontières supported the South Sudan Ministry of Health to implement a hepatitis E vaccination campaign. Three vaccination rounds were conducted, immunizing more than 24 000 people per round, including pregnant women. This was the first ever use of the vaccine to mitigate the consequences of an outbreak, as recommended by WHO in its 2015 Hepatitis E vaccine position paper.  A second campaign was put in place in 2023 to respond to an outbreak in Fangak County, Jonglei State, South Sudan. Hepatitis E vaccine was approved as the fifth vaccine under the International Coordinating Group (ICG) mechanism. WHO is currently working with experts and global partners to make vaccines available as an outbreak response intervention.  In addition, WHO issued the technical report  Waterborne outbreaks of hepatitis E: recognition, investigation and control  in 2014. The manual gives information about the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hepatitis E. It also provides guidance for public health authorities on how to respond to outbreaks of hepatitis E infection. WHO has a key role in global outbreak response and rapid detection and verification of health emergencies. WHO’s global surveillance system picks up public health threats 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Hepatitis E outbreaks are regularly notified to WHO and the organization provides a coordinate 3-level response in support of its members states, if necessary. In 2024, WHO has played a central role in the coordination and response to HEV outbreaks in Chad, South Sudan and Central African Republic, among others.  Global health sector strategies on, respectively, HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections for the period 2022–2030  (GHSSs)  guide the health sector in implementing strategically focused responses to achieve the goals of ending AIDS, viral hepatitis (especially chronic hepatitis B and C)  and sexually transmitted infections by 2030. WHO organizes annual World Hepatitis Day campaigns (as 1 of its 9 flagship annual health campaigns) to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis. For World Hepatitis Day 2024, WHO focused on the theme “It’s time for action” to illustrate the urgency of scaling up viral hepatitis prevention, testing and treatment to prevent liver diseases and cancer and achieve the 2030 hepatitis elimination target.   References", "Overview": "Hepatitis E is inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV).

Some of these outbreaks have occurred in areas of conflict and humanitarian emergencies such as war zones and camps for refugees or internally displaced populations, where sanitation and safe water supply pose special challenges.  The incubation period following exposure to HEV ranges from 2 to 10 weeks, with an average of 5 to 6 weeks. The infected persons excretes the virus beginning from a few days before to 3–4 weeks after onset of the disease. In areas with high disease endemicity, symptomatic infection is most common in young adults aged 15–40 years. In these areas, although infection does occur in children, it often goes undiagnosed because they typically have no symptoms or only a mild illness without jaundice. Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include: These symptoms may be indistinguishable from those experienced during other forms of hepatitis or other infectious diseases in endemic areas, such as leptospirosis, dengue, yellow fever and malaria. The symptoms typically last 1–6 weeks. Although hepatitis E is commonly considered as an acute, self-limited disease, in rare cases acute hepatitis E can be severe and result in fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure). These patients are at risk of death. Pregnant women with hepatitis E, particularly those in the second or third trimester, are at increased risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss and mortality. Up to 20–25% of pregnant women can die if they get hepatitis E in third trimester. Rarely, cases of chronic hepatitis E infection have as well been reported in immunosuppressed people, particularly organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive drugs.  Cases of hepatitis E are not clinically distinguishable from other types of acute viral hepatitis or potentially other infectious disease that cause jaundice. However, diagnosis can often be strongly suspected in appropriate epidemiologic settings, for example when several cases occur in localities in known disease-endemic areas, in settings with risk of water contamination when the disease is more severe in pregnant women or if hepatitis A has been excluded. Definitive diagnosis of hepatitis E infection is usually based on the detection of specific anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the virus in a person’s blood. Rapid tests are available for field use. Other laboratory findings include elevated serum concentrations of bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Additional tests include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the hepatitis E virus RNA in blood and stool. This assay requires specialized laboratory facilities. This test is particularly needed in areas where hepatitis E is infrequent and in uncommon cases with chronic HEV infection. There is no specific antiviral treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis E. As the disease is usually self-limiting, hospitalization is generally not required. It is important to avoid unnecessary medications that can adversely affect liver function, for example acetaminophen (paracetamol). Hospitalization is required for people with fulminant hepatitis and should also be considered for symptomatic pregnant women. Prevention is the most effective approach against the infection. It is particularly important to guarantee that exposed pregnant women have access to appropriate information and prevention measures. At the population level, transmission of HEV and hepatitis E infection can be reduced by: On an individual level, infection risk can be reduced by: HEV prevention and disease control therefore primarily rely on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) measures which are often inadequately implemented in settings which would benefit most.  Additionally, the development of the only currently available Hepatitis E vaccine, known as HEV 239 vaccine (Hecolin®), marks an opportunity to protect vulnerable populations and curb disease outbreaks.  The vaccine has been licensed for use in healthy adults aged  ≥ 16 years in China since 2011 via intramuscular injection using a 3-dose schedule (0, 1 and 6 months). The product is supplied in a pre-filled syringe with an approved shelf life of at least 36 months. In a large, phase III clinical trial in China, it exhibited a high efficacy rate and exhibited a good safety profile, notably in adults aged ≥16 year In March 2022, a significant milestone in the field of hepatitis E vaccination was achieved on the African continent. In response to the hepatitis E outbreak in Bentiu, South Sudan, Médecins Sans Frontières supported the South Sudan Ministry of Health to implement a hepatitis E vaccination campaign. Three vaccination rounds were conducted, immunizing more than 24 000 people per round, including pregnant women. This was the first ever use of the vaccine to mitigate the consequences of an outbreak, as recommended by WHO in its 2015 Hepatitis E vaccine position paper.  A second campaign was put in place in 2023 to respond to an outbreak in Fangak County, Jonglei State, South Sudan. Hepatitis E vaccine was approved as the fifth vaccine under the International Coordinating Group (ICG) mechanism. WHO is currently working with experts and global partners to make vaccines available as an outbreak response intervention.  In addition, WHO issued the technical report  Waterborne outbreaks of hepatitis E: recognition, investigation and control  in 2014. The manual gives information about the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hepatitis E. It also provides guidance for public health authorities on how to respond to outbreaks of hepatitis E infection. WHO has a key role in global outbreak response and rapid detection and verification of health emergencies. WHO’s global surveillance system picks up public health threats 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Hepatitis E outbreaks are regularly notified to WHO and the organization provides a coordinate 3-level response in support of its members states, if necessary. In 2024, WHO has played a central role in the coordination and response to HEV outbreaks in Chad, South Sudan and Central African Republic, among others.  Global health sector strategies on, respectively, HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections for the period 2022–2030  (GHSSs)  guide the health sector in implementing strategically focused responses to achieve the goals of ending AIDS, viral hepatitis (especially chronic hepatitis B and C)  and sexually transmitted infections by 2030. WHO organizes annual World Hepatitis Day campaigns (as 1 of its 9 flagship annual health campaigns) to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis. For World Hepatitis Day 2024, WHO focused on the theme “It’s time for action” to illustrate the urgency of scaling up viral hepatitis prevention, testing and treatment to prevent liver diseases and cancer and achieve the 2030 hepatitis elimination target.   References", "Transmission": "Hepatitis E infection is found worldwide and is common in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene and health services. Infection can occur as outbreaks or as sporadic cases. HEV has four major genotypes that cause human disease (genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4). The genotypes have distinct routes of transmission and geographical distributions. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 primarily infect humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 mainly infect non-human mammals and cause occasional zoonotic disease in humans. The transmission of genotypes 3 and 4 is mainly zoonotic, through consumption of uncooked or undercooked meat, with the environment also a likely source of infection.  Genotype 1 and 2, the most prevalent HEV genotypes in Africa and parts of Asia, are mainly faecal-orally transmitted.

{"title": "Hepatitis D", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Hepatitis D is an inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its replication. Hepatitis D infection cannot occur in the absence of HBV. HDV–HBV co-infection is considered the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis due to more rapid progression towards hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death. Vaccination against hepatitis B can prevent HDV infection. HDV has recently been classified as carcinogenic to humans (class I) by the IARC mongraph programme, just like hepatitis B and C. In a study published in the  Journal of Hepatology  in 2020  (1 ), conducted in collaboration with WHO, it was estimated that hepatitis D virus (HDV) affects nearly 5% of people globally who have a chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and that HDV co-infection could explain about 1 in 5 cases of liver disease and liver cancer in people with HBV infection. The study has identified several geographical hotspots of high prevalence of HDV infection including Mongolia, the Republic of Moldova, and countries in western and central Africa. HDV is blood borne and transmitted in the same way as HBV. Transmission may occur through contact with infected human blood or other bodily fluids. It may also be transmitted through sexual intercourse, or rarely from a mother to her child before or around birth (vertical transmission). HDV can also spread within families in endemic areas.  Chronic HBV carriers are at risk of infection with HDV. People who are not immune to HBV (either by natural disease or immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine) are at risk of infection with HBV, which puts them at risk of HDV infection. Those who are more likely to have HBV and HDV co-infection include indigenous people, people who inject drugs and people with hepatitis C virus or HIV infection. The risk of HDV infection also appears to be potentially higher in recipients of haemodialysis, men who have sex with men and commercial sex workers.  Vaccination against HBV can prevent HDV coinfection and hence expansion of childhood HBV immunization programmes has resulted in a decline in hepatitis D incidence worldwide. Simultaneous infection with HBV and HDV can lead to mild-to-severe hepatitis with signs and symptoms of indistinguishable from those of other types of acute viral hepatitis infections. These features typically appear 3–7 weeks after initial infection and include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, pale-coloured stools, jaundice (yellow eyes) and even fulminant hepatitis. However, recovery is usually complete, development of fulminant hepatitis is infrequent, and progression to chronic hepatitis D is rare (less than 5% of acute hepatitis). In a superinfection, HDV can infect a person already chronically infected with HBV. The superinfection of HDV on chronic hepatitis B accelerates progression to a more severe disease in all ages and in 70‒90% of persons. HDV superinfection markedly accelerates progression to cirrhosis when compared with HBV mono-infected persons. Patients with HDV induced cirrhosis are at an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the mechanism in which HDV causes more severe hepatitis and a faster progression of fibrosis than HBV alone remains unclear. Diagnosing chronic HDV requires serology to demonstrate exposure (past or current infection) and molecular methods to demonstrate the presence of HDV RNA and active infection.  However, HDV diagnostics are not widely available – especially in low- and middle-income countries – and there is only little standardization for HDV RNA assays, which are essential to detect active, viremic infection and for monitoring response to antiviral therapy. Until recently, pegylated interferon α (PEG-IFNα) had been the only treatment option for chronic HDV.  However, its use has been limited by poor treatment outcomes, side-effects and contraindications. Only about 20–30% of those treated with PEG-IFNα achieve complete virological response under treatment, and relapse is frequent.  The HDV treatment landscape is now rapidly evolving, with some novel agents showing favorable results. In 2023, Bulevirtide, an entry inhibitor that is given once daily through subcutaneous injection, received approval for treatment of chronic HDV by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) among adults with compensated liver disease. Several multi-centre studies continue to evaluate best treatment dosage, treatment duration and possible combination with PEG-IFNα.  Nucleoside analogues used for hepatitis B treatment have shown no direct benefit in controlling HDV although they are generally used for managing the chronic HBV infection.  Prevention services of hepatitis D should focus on reducing HBV transmission through hepatitis B immunization, including timely birth dose, additional antiviral prophylaxis for eligible pregnant women, blood safety, safe injection practices in health-care settings and harm reduction services with clean needles and syringes. Hepatitis B immunization does not provide protection against HDV for those already infected with HBV. Global health sector strategies on, respectively, HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections for the period 2022–2030  (GHSS)  guide the health sector in implementing strategically focused responses to achieve the goals of ending AIDS, viral hepatitis (especially chronic hepatitis B and C)  and sexually transmitted infections by 2030. The GHSS recommends shared and disease-specific country approaches supported by actions through WHO and partners. They consider the epidemiological, technological and contextual shifts of previous years, foster learnings across the disease areas, and create opportunities to leverage innovations and new knowledge for effective responses to the diseases. They call to scale up prevention, testing and treatment of viral hepatitis with a focus to reach populations and communities most affected and at risk for each disease, as well as addressing gaps and inequities. They promote synergies under a universal health coverage and primary health care framework and contribute to achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Additionally, WHO released updated  Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B infection  in 2024. These guidelines now include formal recommendations for testing and confirmatory diagnosis of HDV. WHO is working as well to include the key HDV tests into its essential diagnostics list and is working with partners and member states to highlight the importance of a public health response to HDV.  WHO organizes annual World Hepatitis Day campaigns (as 1 of its 9 flagship annual health campaigns) to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis. For World Hepatitis Day 2024, WHO focused on the theme “It’s time for action” to illustrate the urgency of scaling up viral hepatitis prevention, testing and treatment to prevent liver diseases and cancer and achieve the 2030 hepatitis elimination target.", "Overview": "Hepatitis D is an inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its replication. Hepatitis D infection cannot occur in the absence of HBV. HDV–HBV co-infection is considered the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis due to more rapid progression towards hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death. Vaccination against hepatitis B can prevent HDV infection. HDV has recently been classified as carcinogenic to humans (class I) by the IARC mongraph programme, just like hepatitis B and C. In a study published in the  Journal of Hepatology  in 2020  (1 ), conducted in collaboration with WHO, it was estimated that hepatitis D virus (HDV) affects nearly 5% of people globally who have a chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and that HDV co-infection could explain about 1 in 5 cases of liver disease and liver cancer in people with HBV infection. The study has identified several geographical hotspots of high prevalence of HDV infection including Mongolia, the Republic of Moldova, and countries in western and central Africa. HDV is blood borne and transmitted in the same way as HBV. Transmission may occur through contact with infected human blood or other bodily fluids. It may also be transmitted through sexual intercourse, or rarely from a mother to her child before or around birth (vertical transmission). HDV can also spread within families in endemic areas.  Chronic HBV carriers are at risk of infection with HDV. People who are not immune to HBV (either by natural disease or immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine) are at risk of infection with HBV, which puts them at risk of HDV infection.

They consider the epidemiological, technological and contextual shifts of previous years, foster learnings across the disease areas, and create opportunities to leverage innovations and new knowledge for effective responses to the diseases. They call to scale up prevention, testing and treatment of viral hepatitis with a focus to reach populations and communities most affected and at risk for each disease, as well as addressing gaps and inequities. They promote synergies under a universal health coverage and primary health care framework and contribute to achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Additionally, WHO released updated  Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B infection  in 2024. These guidelines now include formal recommendations for testing and confirmatory diagnosis of HDV. WHO is working as well to include the key HDV tests into its essential diagnostics list and is working with partners and member states to highlight the importance of a public health response to HDV.  WHO organizes annual World Hepatitis Day campaigns (as 1 of its 9 flagship annual health campaigns) to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis.

{"title": "Hepatitis C", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Hepatitis C is a viral infection that affects the liver. It can cause both acute (short term) and chronic (long term) illness. It can be life-threatening. Hepatitis C is spread through contact with infected blood. This can happen through unsafe inections and procedures in health care, unscreened blood transfusions, sharing of needles and syringes among people who inject drugs and sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood. Symptoms can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice).  There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but it can be treated and cured with antiviral medications.  Early detection and treatment can prevent serious liver damage and improve long-term health. Acute HCV infections are usually asymptomatic and most do not lead to a life-threatening disease. Around 30% (15–45%) of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection without any treatment. The remaining 70% (55–85%) of persons will develop chronic HCV infection. Of those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis ranges from 15% to 30% within 20 years. Hepatitis C virus infection occurs in all WHO regions. The highest burden of disease is in the Eastern Mediterranean Region with 12 million people chronically infected. In the South-East Asia Region (9 million), European Region (9 million) and the Western Pacific Region (7 million) people are chronically infected. Eight million people are chronically infected in the African Region and 5 million the Region of the Americas. About 2.3 million people of the estimated 39 million living with HIV globally have serological evidence of past or present HCV infection. Chronic liver disease represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality among persons living with HIV globally.  The hepatitis C virus is a bloodborne virus. It is most commonly transmitted through: HCV can be passed from an infected mother to her baby and via sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood (for example, people with multiple sexual partners and among men who have sex with men); however, these modes of transmission are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, water or casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. Symptomatic acute HCV infection is uncommon; if is occurs, most people do not have symptoms in the first weeks after infection. It can take between two weeks and six months to have symptoms. When symptoms do appear, they may include: Because new HCV infections are usually asymptomatic, few people are diagnosed when the infection is recent. In those people who develop chronic HCV infection, the infection is often undiagnosed because it remains asymptomatic until decades after infection when symptoms develop secondary to serious liver damage. HCV infection is diagnosed in 2 steps: After a person has been diagnosed with chronic HCV infection, an assessment should be conducted to determine the degree of liver damage (fibrosis and cirrhosis). This can be done by liver biopsy or through a variety of non-invasive blood tests. The degree of liver damage is used to guide treatment decisions and management of the disease. Early diagnosis can prevent health problems that may result from infection and prevent transmission of the virus. WHO recommends testing people who may be at increased risk of infection in all settings, including among blood donors, people with signs of liver disease, migrants from endemic regions, health-care workers, people who inject drugs (PWID), people in prisons and other closed settings, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, sex workers and HIV- and TB-infected persons. In settings with intermediate and high HCV antibody seroprevalence in the general population (defined as  > 2% HCV antibody seroprevalence), WHO also recommends general population testing in all adolescents and adults.  In 2024, WHO  released an  operational guide  on priorities in planning hepatitis B and C testing services that consolidates all guidance related to viral hepatitis testing and supports countries in developing policies and practices that define a strategic mix of hepatitis B and C testing approaches.  Treatment In November 2013 and January 2014, the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved the very first interferon-free treatment options for chronic hepatitis C. This marked an impressive and truly unique milestone in modern medicine and public health, as it became possible to cure a severe, life-threatening chronic infectious disease within 8–12 weeks of therapy in nearly all patients.  WHO recommends therapy with pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for all adults, adolescents and children down to 3 years of age with chronic hepatitis C infection. The short-course oral, curative DAA treatment regimens has few if any side-effects. DAAs can cure most persons with HCV infection, and treatment duration is short (usually 12 to 24 weeks), depending on the absence or presence of cirrhosis. In 2022, WHO included new recommendations for treatment of adolescents and children using the same pangenotypic treatments used for adults.   Pan-genotypic DAAs remain expensive in many high- and upper-middle-income countries. However, prices have dropped dramatically in many countries (primarily low-income and lower-middle-income countries) due to the introduction of generic versions of these medicines. The most widely used and low-cost pangenotypic DAA regimen is sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. In many low- and middle-income countries the standard curative treatment course is available for less than US$ 50. Access to HCV treatment is improving but remains limited. Of the 50 million people living with HCV infection globally in 2022, an estimated 36% people knew their diagnosis, and of those diagnosed with chronic HCV infection, around 20% (12.5 million) people had been treated with DAAs by the end of 2022. People with hepatitis C may also benefit from lifestyle changes, such as avoiding alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight. With proper treatment, many people can be cured from hepatitis C infection and live healthy lives. Service delivery Until recently, delivery of hepatitis C testing and treatment in many countries relied on specialist-led (usually by a hepatologist or gastroenterologist) care models in hospital settings to administer complex treatment. With the short-course oral, curative pangenotypic HCV DAA treatment regimens with few if any side-effects, minimal expertise and monitoring are now required. WHO recommends that testing, care and treatment for persons with chronic hepatitis C infection can be provided by trained non-specialist doctors and nurses, using simplified service delivery that includes decentralization, integration and task shifting. This can be done in primary care, harm reduction services and prisons which is more accessible and convenient for patients. Testing, care and treatment can now also be provided safely in primary care, harm reduction services and prisons which is more accessible and convenient for patients. There is no effective vaccine against hepatitis C. The best way to prevent the disease is to avoid contact with infected blood.

WHO recommends testing people who may be at increased risk of infection in all settings, including among blood donors, people with signs of liver disease, migrants from endemic regions, health-care workers, people who inject drugs (PWID), people in prisons and other closed settings, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, sex workers and HIV- and TB-infected persons. In settings with intermediate and high HCV antibody seroprevalence in the general population (defined as  > 2% HCV antibody seroprevalence), WHO also recommends general population testing in all adolescents and adults.  In 2024, WHO  released an  operational guide  on priorities in planning hepatitis B and C testing services that consolidates all guidance related to viral hepatitis testing and supports countries in developing policies and practices that define a strategic mix of hepatitis B and C testing approaches.  Treatment In November 2013 and January 2014, the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved the very first interferon-free treatment options for chronic hepatitis C. This marked an impressive and truly unique milestone in modern medicine and public health, as it became possible to cure a severe, life-threatening chronic infectious disease within 8–12 weeks of therapy in nearly all patients.  WHO recommends therapy with pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for all adults, adolescents and children down to 3 years of age with chronic hepatitis C infection. The short-course oral, curative DAA treatment regimens has few if any side-effects. DAAs can cure most persons with HCV infection, and treatment duration is short (usually 12 to 24 weeks), depending on the absence or presence of cirrhosis. In 2022, WHO included new recommendations for treatment of adolescents and children using the same pangenotypic treatments used for adults.   Pan-genotypic DAAs remain expensive in many high- and upper-middle-income countries. However, prices have dropped dramatically in many countries (primarily low-income and lower-middle-income countries) due to the introduction of generic versions of these medicines. The most widely used and low-cost pangenotypic DAA regimen is sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. In many low- and middle-income countries the standard curative treatment course is available for less than US$ 50. Access to HCV treatment is improving but remains limited. Of the 50 million people living with HCV infection globally in 2022, an estimated 36% people knew their diagnosis, and of those diagnosed with chronic HCV infection, around 20% (12.5 million) people had been treated with DAAs by the end of 2022. People with hepatitis C may also benefit from lifestyle changes, such as avoiding alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight. With proper treatment, many people can be cured from hepatitis C infection and live healthy lives. Service delivery Until recently, delivery of hepatitis C testing and treatment in many countries relied on specialist-led (usually by a hepatologist or gastroenterologist) care models in hospital settings to administer complex treatment. With the short-course oral, curative pangenotypic HCV DAA treatment regimens with few if any side-effects, minimal expertise and monitoring are now required. WHO recommends that testing, care and treatment for persons with chronic hepatitis C infection can be provided by trained non-specialist doctors and nurses, using simplified service delivery that includes decentralization, integration and task shifting. This can be done in primary care, harm reduction services and prisons which is more accessible and convenient for patients. Testing, care and treatment can now also be provided safely in primary care, harm reduction services and prisons which is more accessible and convenient for patients. There is no effective vaccine against hepatitis C. The best way to prevent the disease is to avoid contact with infected blood. People at higher risk of infection include those who inject drugs, men who have sex with men,those living with HIV and those exposed to repeated health-care procedures. Ways to prevent hepatitis C include: Global health sector strategies on, respectively, HIV, viral hepatitis, and\r\n    sexually transmitted infections for the period 2022–2030  (GHSSs) \r\n guide the health sector in implementing strategically focused responses to\r\n    achieve the goals of ending AIDS, viral hepatitis (especially chronic hepatitis\r\n    B and C) and sexually transmitted infections by 2030. The GHSS recommend shared and disease-specific country actions supported by\r\n    actions by WHO and partners. They consider the epidemiological, technological,\r\n    and contextual shifts of previous years, foster learnings across the disease\r\n    areas, and create opportunities to leverage innovations and new knowledge for\r\n    effective responses to the diseases.

They promote synergies under a universal health coverage\r\n    and primary health care framework and contribute to achieving the goals of the\r\n    2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. WHO supports countries to develop national strategies in line with this vision.  Furthermore, WHO develops and updates guidelines for the prevention, testing and treatment of HCV and supports countries to reflect the latest science and recommendations in their public health response.  Moreover, WHO collaborates with UNITAID in the implementation of a HCV investment in 10 countries for people who use drugs and people in prisons to catalyze best practice in integrating HCV prevention and treatment in community harm reduction settings and in facilitating introduction of innovative and under-used HCV prevention products (long-acting depot buprenorphine and low dead-space syringes).  WHO also organizes annual World Hepatitis Day campaigns to increase awareness and understanding of viral\r\n    hepatitis.", "Testing and diagnosis": "Because new HCV infections are usually asymptomatic, few people are diagnosed when the infection is recent. In those people who develop chronic HCV infection, the infection is often undiagnosed because it remains asymptomatic until decades after infection when symptoms develop secondary to serious liver damage. HCV infection is diagnosed in 2 steps: After a person has been diagnosed with chronic HCV infection, an assessment should be conducted to determine the degree of liver damage (fibrosis and cirrhosis). This can be done by liver biopsy or through a variety of non-invasive blood tests. The degree of liver damage is used to guide treatment decisions and management of the disease. Early diagnosis can prevent health problems that may result from infection and prevent transmission of the virus.

{"title": "Hepatitis B", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus. The infection can be acute (short and severe) or chronic (long term). Hepatitis B can cause a chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. It can spread through contact with infected body fluids like blood, saliva, vaginal fluids and semen. It can also be passed from a mother to her baby. Hepatitis B can be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. The vaccine is usually given soon after birth with boosters a few weeks later. It offers nearly 100% protection against the virus. Hepatitis B is a major global health problem. The burden of infection is highest in the WHO Western Pacific Region and the WHO African Region, where 97 million and 65 million people, respectively, are chronically infected. Sixty-one million people are infected in the WHO South-East Asia Region, 15 million in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, 11 million in the WHO in the WHO European Region and 5 million in the WHO Region of the Americas. In highly endemic areas, hepatitis B is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth (perinatal transmission) or through horizontal transmission, especially from an infected child to an uninfected child during the first 5 years of life. The development of chronic infection is very common in infants infected from their mothers or before the age of 5 years. Hepatitis B is also spread by needlestick injury, tattooing, piercing and exposure to infected blood and body fluids, such as saliva and menstrual, vaginal and seminal fluids. Transmission of the virus may also occur through the sharing or reuse of contaminated needles and syringes or sharp objects either in health care settings, in the community or among persons who inject drugs. Sexual transmission is more prevalent in unvaccinated persons with multiple sexual partners. Hepatitis B infection acquired in adulthood leads to chronic hepatitis in less than 5% of cases, whereas infection in infancy and early childhood leads to chronic hepatitis in about 95% of cases. This is the basis for strengthening and prioritizing infant and childhood vaccination. Symptoms Most people do not experience any symptoms when newly infected.  Some people have acute illness with symptoms that last several weeks: When severe, acute hepatitis can lead to liver failure, which can lead to death. Although most people will recover from acute illness, some people with chronic hepatitis B will develop progressive liver disease and complications like cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). These diseases can be fatal.  About 1% of persons living with HBV infection (2.7 million people) are also infected with HIV. Conversely, the global prevalence of HBV infection in HIV-infected persons is 7.4%. Since 2015, WHO has recommended treatment for everyone diagnosed with HIV infection, regardless of the stage of disease. Tenofovir, which is included in the treatment combinations recommended as first-line therapy for HIV infection, is also active against HBV. It is not possible on clinical grounds to differentiate hepatitis B from hepatitis caused by other viral agents; hence laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is essential. Several blood tests are available to diagnose and monitor people with hepatitis B. Some laboratory tests can be used to distinguish acute and chronic infections, whilst other can assess and monitor the severity of liver disease. Physical examination, ultrasound and elastography can also be performed to assess degree of liver fibrosis and scarring and monitor progression of liver disease. WHO recommends that all blood donations be tested for hepatitis B to ensure blood safety and avoid accidental transmission. As of 2022, 13% of all people estimated to be living with hepatitis B were aware of their infection, while 3% (7 million) of the people living with chronic hepatitis B were on treatment. According to latest WHO estimates, the proportion of children under five years of age chronically infected with HBV dropped to just under 1% in 2019 down from around 5% in the pre-vaccine era ranging from the 1980s to the early 2000s. In settings with intermediate and high Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroprevalence in the general population (defined as  > 2% HBsAg seroprevalence), WHO recommends that all adults have access to and be offered HBsAg testing with linkage to prevention and care and treatment services as needed. WHO also recommends targeted testing, in all settings, of people with suspicions of liver disease, blood donors, and all pregnant women, the latter in order to provide the opportunity to institute measures for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). In addition, WHO recommends testing among specific high-risk groups, including migrants from endemic regions, partners or family members of infected persons, health-care workers, people who inject drugs (PWID), people in prisons and other closed settings, men who have sex with men (MSM) sex workers, transgender people and people living with HIV. There is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B. Chronic hepatitis B can be treated with antiviral medications.  Care for people with acute hepatitis B should focus on managing sympoms. They should eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of liquids to prevent dehydration from vomiting and diarrhoea.  Chronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with oral medicines, including tenofovir or entecavir.  Treatment can  Most people who start hepatitis B treatment must continue it for life. With the updated  Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B infection , released in 2024, it is estimated that more than 50% of people with chronic hepatitis B infection will require treatment, depending on setting and eligibility criteria.  In low-income settings, most people with liver cancer present late in the course of the disease and die within months of diagnosis. In high-income countries, patients present to hospital earlier in the course of the disease and have access to surgery and chemotherapy, which can prolong life for several months to a few years. Liver transplantation is sometimes used in people with cirrhosis or liver cancer in technologically advanced countries, with varying success. Hepatitis B is preventable with a vaccine. All babies should receive the hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth (within 24 hours). This is followed by two or three doses of hepatitis B vaccine at least four weeks apart.  Booster vaccines are not usually required for people who have completed the three-dose vaccination series. The vaccine protects against hepatitis B for at least 20 years and probably for life. Hepatitis B can be passed from mother to child. This can be prevented by taking antiviral medicines to prevent transmission, in addition to the vaccine shortly after birth.  To reduce the risk of getting or spreading hepatitis B: Global health sector strategies on, respectively, HIV, viral hepatitis, and\r\n    sexually transmitted infections for the period 2022–2030  (GHSSs)  guide the health sector in implementing strategically focused responses to\r\n    achieve the goals of ending AIDS, viral hepatitis (especially chronic hepatitis\r\n    B and C) and sexually transmitted infections by 2030.

In settings with intermediate and high Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroprevalence in the general population (defined as  > 2% HBsAg seroprevalence), WHO recommends that all adults have access to and be offered HBsAg testing with linkage to prevention and care and treatment services as needed. WHO also recommends targeted testing, in all settings, of people with suspicions of liver disease, blood donors, and all pregnant women, the latter in order to provide the opportunity to institute measures for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). In addition, WHO recommends testing among specific high-risk groups, including migrants from endemic regions, partners or family members of infected persons, health-care workers, people who inject drugs (PWID), people in prisons and other closed settings, men who have sex with men (MSM) sex workers, transgender people and people living with HIV. There is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B. Chronic hepatitis B can be treated with antiviral medications.  Care for people with acute hepatitis B should focus on managing sympoms. They should eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of liquids to prevent dehydration from vomiting and diarrhoea.  Chronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with oral medicines, including tenofovir or entecavir.  Treatment can  Most people who start hepatitis B treatment must continue it for life. With the updated  Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B infection , released in 2024, it is estimated that more than 50% of people with chronic hepatitis B infection will require treatment, depending on setting and eligibility criteria.  In low-income settings, most people with liver cancer present late in the course of the disease and die within months of diagnosis. In high-income countries, patients present to hospital earlier in the course of the disease and have access to surgery and chemotherapy, which can prolong life for several months to a few years. Liver transplantation is sometimes used in people with cirrhosis or liver cancer in technologically advanced countries, with varying success. Hepatitis B is preventable with a vaccine. All babies should receive the hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth (within 24 hours). This is followed by two or three doses of hepatitis B vaccine at least four weeks apart.  Booster vaccines are not usually required for people who have completed the three-dose vaccination series. The vaccine protects against hepatitis B for at least 20 years and probably for life.

Conversely, the global prevalence of HBV infection in HIV-infected persons is 7.4%. Since 2015, WHO has recommended treatment for everyone diagnosed with HIV infection, regardless of the stage of disease. Tenofovir, which is included in the treatment combinations recommended as first-line therapy for HIV infection, is also active against HBV. It is not possible on clinical grounds to differentiate hepatitis B from hepatitis caused by other viral agents; hence laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is essential. Several blood tests are available to diagnose and monitor people with hepatitis B. Some laboratory tests can be used to distinguish acute and chronic infections, whilst other can assess and monitor the severity of liver disease. Physical examination, ultrasound and elastography can also be performed to assess degree of liver fibrosis and scarring and monitor progression of liver disease.

{"title": "Gonorrhoea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection)", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Gonorrhoea is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacteria. It usually spreads through vaginal, oral or anal sex. Gonorrhoea is treatable and curable with antibiotics.  Most cases of gonorrhoea can be prevented with regular and correct condom use.  Gonorrhoea causes different symptoms in women and men. Women often feel no symptoms, but untreated infection can lead to infertility and problems during pregnancy.  Common symptoms in men include pain or burning when urinating, discharge from the penis and sometimes pain in the testes. Gonorrhoea can be passed from a pregnant mother to her baby. Gonococcal infection increases the risk of getting and spreading HIV. In 2020, WHO estimated 82.4 million new infections with  N. gonorrhoeae  among adults aged 15 to 49 years. Prevalence of gonorrhoea is highest among priority populations such as men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender women and adolescents and young people in high burden countries. Gonorrhoea is treatable and can be cured with some antibiotics. However,  the emergence of N. gonorrhoeae resistant to antibiotics  are making treatment of gonorrhoea more and more challenging, with the risk of becoming untreatable. Rational use of antibiotics and the development of new ones are critical to decrease this eminent threat. Gonorrhoea can cause symptoms in the genitals, anus or throat. Men and women may experience different symptoms. Symptoms usually begin 1–14 days after sexual contact with an infected person. In men, common symptoms include: Most women with gonorrhoea do not have symptoms or do not notice them. If they occur, they can include: Anal infection in women and men can cause: Throat infections often have no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they can include redness, pain and sore throat. Infants born to mothers with gonorrhoea may develop an eye infection. This causes redness, pain, soreness, ulcers and tearing. This is preventable with eye medications for newborns.  Untreated  N. gonorrhoeae  infections can lead to complications and sequelae in women, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, and infertility.  Complications in men are scrotal swelling, urethral stricture and infertility.  Neonatal conjunctivitis (eye infection) if untreated may lead to blindness.  In rare cases, disseminated gonococcal infection can occur and it is manifested as fever and infection in multiple organs of the body such as skin, heart, joints and meninges.  Infection with gonorrhoea can cause stigma and affect personal relationships. These effects are important but often not quantifiable.  Molecular tests are the gold standard for diagnosing  N. gonorrhoeae  which can be performed in the laboratory or at the point of care. Rapid diagnostic tests are currently under development.  Gram stain microscopy is used in some laboratories. However, this method is less sensitive in women with vaginal/cervical discharge as well as for throat and anal infections. In many primary health care settings where diagnostic capacity for detecting  N. gonorrhoeae  through molecular tests is not available,  a syndromic approach  for case management is recommended. Sexual history taking and risk assessment are crucial in evaluating a service user before diagnosis. Clinical examination, speculum examination (in women) and palpation can provide important clues to clinical diagnosis.  Urine samples (preferred for men) are commonly used for diagnosing gonorrhoea through molecular tests or gram stain microscopy, but swabs (preferred for women) from genital and other sites (anus, throat, conjunctiva) can be used depending on the location of symptoms, sexual practices and medical history.   Because the majority of cases are without symptoms,  screening strategies for populations at increased risk  of gonorrhoea to prevent the spread of infection and the development of complications is recommended. Testing is usually coupled with tests for other sexually transmitted infections (such as HIV, syphilis and chlamydia). Antimicrobial sensitivity testing (also known as drug susceptibility testing) for  N. gonorrhoeae  is done in cases of clinical treatment failure to check if the pathogen is resistant to medications. WHO recommends that countries monitor their patterns of antimicrobial resistance to inform treatment recommendations. People with gonorrhoea should be treated as soon as possible. Gonorrhoea is treated with antibiotics called cephalosporins. These include: People should wait 7 days after taking the medicine before having sex. They should notify their sexual partner(s) to get tested or treated.   Treatments can fail due to:  People with gonorrhoea should continue treatment until the infection is cured.  Most cases of gonorrhoea can be prevented with consistent and correct condom use in every sexual encounter. People with gonorrhoea should notify  current and recent sexual partner(s) to help prevent the spread of the disease. Antibiotic eye ointment is recommended for newborns to prevent gonococcal eye infection.  There are no specific vaccines for the prevention of gonorrhoea. However, studies are showing promising results with the use of a meningococcal type B vaccine (4CMenB) that seems to offer cross-protection against gonorrhoea. WHO is monitoring vaccine trials results. WHO has recognized gonorrhoea as a significant public health problem and has set ambitious targets to reduce the global burden through prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. The  Global Health Sector Strategies on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs 2022–2030  aims to reduce the incidence of  N. gonorrhoeae  infection by 90% by 2030, compared to 2020 baseline. WHO is working with countries and partners to improve people-centred case management approaches, ensure  appropriate treatment recommendations  and effective testing and partner services strategies, support the development of new easy to use and affordable diagnostics and treatment, vaccine development and improve surveillance.

Infants born to mothers with gonorrhoea may develop an eye infection. This causes redness, pain, soreness, ulcers and tearing. This is preventable with eye medications for newborns.  Untreated  N. gonorrhoeae  infections can lead to complications and sequelae in women, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, and infertility.  Complications in men are scrotal swelling, urethral stricture and infertility.  Neonatal conjunctivitis (eye infection) if untreated may lead to blindness.  In rare cases, disseminated gonococcal infection can occur and it is manifested as fever and infection in multiple organs of the body such as skin, heart, joints and meninges.  Infection with gonorrhoea can cause stigma and affect personal relationships. These effects are important but often not quantifiable.  Molecular tests are the gold standard for diagnosing  N. gonorrhoeae  which can be performed in the laboratory or at the point of care. Rapid diagnostic tests are currently under development.  Gram stain microscopy is used in some laboratories. However, this method is less sensitive in women with vaginal/cervical discharge as well as for throat and anal infections. In many primary health care settings where diagnostic capacity for detecting  N. gonorrhoeae  through molecular tests is not available,  a syndromic approach  for case management is recommended. Sexual history taking and risk assessment are crucial in evaluating a service user before diagnosis. Clinical examination, speculum examination (in women) and palpation can provide important clues to clinical diagnosis.  Urine samples (preferred for men) are commonly used for diagnosing gonorrhoea through molecular tests or gram stain microscopy, but swabs (preferred for women) from genital and other sites (anus, throat, conjunctiva) can be used depending on the location of symptoms, sexual practices and medical history.   Because the majority of cases are without symptoms,  screening strategies for populations at increased risk  of gonorrhoea to prevent the spread of infection and the development of complications is recommended. Testing is usually coupled with tests for other sexually transmitted infections (such as HIV, syphilis and chlamydia). Antimicrobial sensitivity testing (also known as drug susceptibility testing) for  N. gonorrhoeae  is done in cases of clinical treatment failure to check if the pathogen is resistant to medications. WHO recommends that countries monitor their patterns of antimicrobial resistance to inform treatment recommendations. People with gonorrhoea should be treated as soon as possible. Gonorrhoea is treated with antibiotics called cephalosporins. These include: People should wait 7 days after taking the medicine before having sex. They should notify their sexual partner(s) to get tested or treated.   Treatments can fail due to:  People with gonorrhoea should continue treatment until the infection is cured.  Most cases of gonorrhoea can be prevented with consistent and correct condom use in every sexual encounter. People with gonorrhoea should notify  current and recent sexual partner(s) to help prevent the spread of the disease. Antibiotic eye ointment is recommended for newborns to prevent gonococcal eye infection.  There are no specific vaccines for the prevention of gonorrhoea. However, studies are showing promising results with the use of a meningococcal type B vaccine (4CMenB) that seems to offer cross-protection against gonorrhoea. WHO is monitoring vaccine trials results. WHO has recognized gonorrhoea as a significant public health problem and has set ambitious targets to reduce the global burden through prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. The  Global Health Sector Strategies on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs 2022–2030  aims to reduce the incidence of  N. gonorrhoeae  infection by 90% by 2030, compared to 2020 baseline. WHO is working with countries and partners to improve people-centred case management approaches, ensure  appropriate treatment recommendations  and effective testing and partner services strategies, support the development of new easy to use and affordable diagnostics and treatment, vaccine development and improve surveillance. WHO also works with countries and partners to improve antimicrobial resistance stewardship through the  Enhanced Gonorrhoea Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (EGASP) , which includes the implementation and use of better surveillance systems to detect antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae and to inform locally appropriate treatment.", "Signs and symptoms": "Gonorrhoea can cause symptoms in the genitals, anus or throat.

{"title": "Epilepsy", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Epilepsy is a chronic noncommunicable disease of the brain that affects around 50 million people worldwide. It is characterized by recurrent seizures, which are brief episodes of involuntary movement that may involve a part of the body (partial) or the entire body (generalized) and are sometimes accompanied by loss of consciousness and control of bowel or bladder function. Seizure episodes are a result of excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells. Different parts of the brain can be the site of such discharges. Seizures can vary from the briefest lapses of attention or muscle jerks to severe and prolonged convulsions. Seizures can also vary in frequency, from less than one per year to several per day. One seizure does not signify epilepsy (up to 10% of people worldwide have one seizure during their lifetime). Epilepsy is defined as having two or more unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is one of the world’s oldest recognized conditions, with written records dating back to 4000 BCE. Fear, misunderstanding, discrimination and social stigma have surrounded epilepsy for centuries. This stigma continues in many countries today and can impact on the quality of life for people with the disease and their families. Characteristics of seizures vary and depend on where in the brain the disturbance first starts, and how far it spreads. Temporary symptoms occur, such as loss of awareness or consciousness, and disturbances of movement, sensation (including vision, hearing and taste), mood, or other cognitive functions. People with epilepsy tend to have more physical problems (such as fractures and bruising from injuries related to seizures), as well as higher rates of psychological conditions, including anxiety and depression. Similarly, the risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is up to three times higher than in the general population, with the highest rates of premature mortality found in low- and middle-income countries and in rural areas. A great proportion of the causes of death related to epilepsy, especially in low- and middle-income countries, are potentially preventable, such as falls, drowning, burns and prolonged seizures. Epilepsy accounts for a significant proportion of the world’s disease burden, affecting around 50 million people worldwide. The estimated proportion of the general population with active epilepsy (i.e. continuing seizures or with the need for treatment) at a given time is between 4 and 10 per 1000 people. Globally, an estimated 5 million people are diagnosed with epilepsy each year. In high-income countries, there are estimated to be 49 per 100 000 people diagnosed with epilepsy each year. In low- and middle-income countries, this figure can be as high as 139 per 100 000. This is likely due to the increased risk of endemic conditions such as malaria or neurocysticercosis; the higher incidence of road traffic injuries; birth-related injuries; and variations in medical infrastructure, the availability of preventive health programmes and accessible care. Close to 80% of people with epilepsy live in low- and middle-income countries. Epilepsy is not contagious. Although many underlying disease mechanisms can lead to epilepsy, the cause of the disease is still unknown in about 50% of cases globally. The causes of epilepsy are divided into the following categories: structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune and unknown. Examples include: Seizures can be controlled. Up to 70% of people living with epilepsy could become seizure free with appropriate use of antiseizure medicines. Discontinuing antiseizure medicine can be considered after 2 years without seizures and should take into account relevant clinical, social and personal factors. A documented etiology of the seizure and an abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) pattern are the two most consistent predictors of seizure recurrence. An estimated 25% of epilepsy cases are potentially preventable. Epilepsy accounts for more than 0.5% of the global burden of disease, a time-based measure that combines years of life lost due to premature mortality and time lived in less than full health. Epilepsy has significant economic implications in terms of health-care needs, premature death and lost work productivity. Out-of-pocket costs and productivity losses can create substantial burdens on households. An economic study from India estimated that public financing for both first- and second-line therapy and other medical costs alleviates the financial burden from epilepsy and is cost-effective. The stigma and discrimination that surround epilepsy worldwide are often more difficult to overcome than the seizures themselves. People living with epilepsy and their families can be targets of prejudice. Pervasive myths that epilepsy is incurable, or contagious, or a result of morally bad behaviour can keep people isolated and discourage them from seeking treatment.  People with epilepsy can experience reduced access to educational opportunities, a withholding of the opportunity to obtain a driving license, barriers to enter particular occupations, and reduced access to health and life insurance. In many countries legislation reflects centuries of misunderstanding about epilepsy, for example, laws which permit the annulment of a marriage on the grounds of epilepsy and laws that deny people with seizures access to restaurants, theatres, recreational centres and other public buildings. Legislation based on internationally accepted human rights standards can prevent discrimination and rights violations, improve access to health-care services, and raise the quality of life for people with epilepsy. The ﬁrst global report on epilepsy produced in 2019 by WHO and key partners,  Epilepsy: A public health imperative , highlighted the available evidence on the burden of epilepsy and the public health response required at global, regional and national levels. The 75th WHA adopted the Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders 2022–2031, which recognizes the shared preventive, pharmacological and psychosocial approaches between epilepsy and other neurological disorders that can serve as valuable entry points for accelerating and strengthening services and support for these conditions. Recently, WHO published an epilepsy technical brief, which outlines actions for policy makers and healthcare planners to reduce the burden of epilepsy in countries through finding and prioritizing the most effective solutions in a wide range of societal sectors. WHO, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) led the Global Campaign Against Epilepsy to bring the disease out of the shadows to provide better information and raise awareness about epilepsy and to strengthen public and private efforts to improve care and reduce the disease’s impact. These efforts have contributed to the prioritization of epilepsy in many countries and projects have been carried out to reduce the treatment gap and morbidity of people with epilepsy, to train and educate health professionals, to dispel stigma, to identify potential prevention strategies, and to develop models integrating epilepsy care into local health systems. Combining several innovative strategies, these projects have shown that there are simple, cost-effective ways to treat epilepsy in low-resource settings. The WHO Programme on reducing the epilepsy treatment gap and the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) achieved these goals in Ghana, Mozambique, Myanmar and Viet Nam, where 6.5 million more people have access to treatment for epilepsy should they need it.", "Signs and symptoms": "Characteristics of seizures vary and depend on where in the brain the disturbance first starts, and how far it spreads.

Legislation based on internationally accepted human rights standards can prevent discrimination and rights violations, improve access to health-care services, and raise the quality of life for people with epilepsy. The ﬁrst global report on epilepsy produced in 2019 by WHO and key partners,  Epilepsy: A public health imperative , highlighted the available evidence on the burden of epilepsy and the public health response required at global, regional and national levels. The 75th WHA adopted the Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders 2022–2031, which recognizes the shared preventive, pharmacological and psychosocial approaches between epilepsy and other neurological disorders that can serve as valuable entry points for accelerating and strengthening services and support for these conditions. Recently, WHO published an epilepsy technical brief, which outlines actions for policy makers and healthcare planners to reduce the burden of epilepsy in countries through finding and prioritizing the most effective solutions in a wide range of societal sectors. WHO, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) led the Global Campaign Against Epilepsy to bring the disease out of the shadows to provide better information and raise awareness about epilepsy and to strengthen public and private efforts to improve care and reduce the disease’s impact. These efforts have contributed to the prioritization of epilepsy in many countries and projects have been carried out to reduce the treatment gap and morbidity of people with epilepsy, to train and educate health professionals, to dispel stigma, to identify potential prevention strategies, and to develop models integrating epilepsy care into local health systems. Combining several innovative strategies, these projects have shown that there are simple, cost-effective ways to treat epilepsy in low-resource settings. The WHO Programme on reducing the epilepsy treatment gap and the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) achieved these goals in Ghana, Mozambique, Myanmar and Viet Nam, where 6.5 million more people have access to treatment for epilepsy should they need it.", "Causes": "Epilepsy is not contagious. Although many underlying disease mechanisms can lead to epilepsy, the cause of the disease is still unknown in about 50% of cases globally. The causes of epilepsy are divided into the following categories: structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune and unknown. Examples include: Seizures can be controlled. Up to 70% of people living with epilepsy could become seizure free with appropriate use of antiseizure medicines. Discontinuing antiseizure medicine can be considered after 2 years without seizures and should take into account relevant clinical, social and personal factors. A documented etiology of the seizure and an abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) pattern are the two most consistent predictors of seizure recurrence. An estimated 25% of epilepsy cases are potentially preventable. Epilepsy accounts for more than 0.5% of the global burden of disease, a time-based measure that combines years of life lost due to premature mortality and time lived in less than full health. Epilepsy has significant economic implications in terms of health-care needs, premature death and lost work productivity. Out-of-pocket costs and productivity losses can create substantial burdens on households. An economic study from India estimated that public financing for both first- and second-line therapy and other medical costs alleviates the financial burden from epilepsy and is cost-effective. The stigma and discrimination that surround epilepsy worldwide are often more difficult to overcome than the seizures themselves. People living with epilepsy and their families can be targets of prejudice. Pervasive myths that epilepsy is incurable, or contagious, or a result of morally bad behaviour can keep people isolated and discourage them from seeking treatment.

{"title": "Ebola disease", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Ebola disease (EBOD) is a rare but severe illness in humans  (1) . It is often fatal.  Ebola disease is caused by viruses that belong to the  Orthoebolavirus  genus of the  filoviridae  family  (2) . Six species of Orthoebolaviruses have been identified to date, with three known to cause large outbreaks: Ebola disease first occurred in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks: one outbreak was of Sudan virus disease in Nzara in what is now South Sudan, and the other outbreak was of Ebola virus disease in Yambuku, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name. While there are licensed vaccines and therapeutics for Ebola virus disease, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for other Ebola diseases, such as SVD or BVD. Candidate products are in development.  Early intensive supportive care including rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms, can improve survival. Seeking early care can be lifesaving.  It is thought that fruit bats of the  Pteropodidae  family are natural hosts of the Orthoebolavirus. The virus can get into the human population when people have close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest. People can get infected with the virus from another person by direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with: People cannot transmit the disease before they have symptoms, and they remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Health and care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with Ebola disease. This occurs through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of a person who has died can also contribute to the transmission of Ebola disease. The incubation period or interval from infection to onset of symptoms varies from 2 to 21 days. The symptoms of Ebola disease can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, malaise, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. These are followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain rash, and symptoms of impaired kidney and liver functions. It is important for health and care workers to be on the lookout for these symptoms.  Despite a perception that bleeding is a common symptom, this is less frequent and can occur later in the disease. Some patients may develop internal and external bleeding, including blood in vomit and faeces, bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina. Bleeding at the sites where needles have punctured the skin can also occur.  The impact on the central nervous system can result in confusion, irritability and aggression. It can be difficult to clinically distinguish Ebola disease from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers because symptoms at early stage of the disease are similar.  Confirmation that the person has an Orthoebolavirus infection is made using the following diagnostic methods: Samples collected from patients are an extreme biohazard risk; laboratory testing on non-inactivated samples should be conducted under maximum biological containment conditions. All non-inactivated biological specimens should be packaged using the triple packaging system when transported nationally and internationally See  Diagnostic testing for Ebola and Marburg diseases . Over the years, WHO and partners have developed  guidance  and training that outline how to provide the best possible care for patients and increase their chance of survival, whether or not specific treatments are being used. Called optimized supportive care, this covers the relevant tests to administer, how to manage pain, nutrition and co-infections (such as malaria), and other approaches that put the patient on the best path to recovery. For Ebola virus disease,  WHO made strong recommendations  for treatment with mAb114 (ansuvimab TM ) or REGN-EB3 (Inmazeb TM ) that are both monoclonal antibodies. For other Ebola diseases, such as SVD or BVD, there are no approved therapeutics,  but candidate products are under development  and a  CORE protocol  for clinical trials is available.  For Ebola virus disease:  For other Ebola diseases, such as SVD: Community engagement is key to successfully controlling any outbreak. Outbreak control relies on using a range of interventions, such as clinical care, surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory services, infection prevention and control in health facilities, safe and dignified burials, vaccination (only for Ebola virus disease) and social mobilization.  Raising awareness of risk factors and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. Risk reduction messaging should focus on several factors: Health-care workers should always take  standard precautions  when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials), safe injection practices and safe and dignified burial practices. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola disease should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patients’ blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding.  Infection prevention and control guideline for Ebola and Marburg diseases .  Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Orthoebolavirus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories. All survivors, their partners and families should be shown respect, dignity and compassion. WHO does not recommend isolation of recovered patients whose blood has tested negative for Orthoebolavirus. Survivors might suffer from both clinical and psychological sequelae. WHO encourages affected countries to consider  the establishment of care programme  to alleviate sequelae, support to community reintegration, counselling and biological testing.  Orthoebolaviruses are known to persist in immune-privileged sites in some people who have recovered. These sites include the testicles, the inside of the eye and the brain. Relapse-symptomatic illness in the absence of re-infection in someone who has recovered from Ebola disease is rare but has been documented. Reasons for this phenomenon are not yet fully understood. Ebola virus transmission via infected semen has been documented up to fifteen months after clinical recovery. To mitigate the risk of this transmission, a semen testing programme should be implemented to:  In the absence of a semen testing programme, male survivors should follow safer sex practices for 12 months.  Orthoebolavirus may persist in the placenta, amniotic fluid and fetus of women infected while pregnant, and in the breast milk of breastfeeding women who are infected with the virus. Survivor care programmes should encompass care for pregnant and breastfeeding women after their recovery.    WHO works with countries to prevent Ebola outbreaks by maintaining surveillance and supporting at-risk countries to develop preparedness plans. The following document provides overall guidance for control of Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks:   Ebola and Marburg virus disease epidemics: preparedness, alert, control, and evaluation When an outbreak is detected, WHO responds by supporting outbreak response, disease detection, community engagement, contact tracing, vaccination, vaccine and treatment trials, case management, laboratory services, infection control, logistics, and training and assistance with safe and dignified burial practices.   References", "Transmission": "It is thought that fruit bats of the  Pteropodidae  family are natural hosts of the Orthoebolavirus.

Confirmation that the person has an Orthoebolavirus infection is made using the following diagnostic methods: Samples collected from patients are an extreme biohazard risk; laboratory testing on non-inactivated samples should be conducted under maximum biological containment conditions. All non-inactivated biological specimens should be packaged using the triple packaging system when transported nationally and internationally See  Diagnostic testing for Ebola and Marburg diseases . Over the years, WHO and partners have developed  guidance  and training that outline how to provide the best possible care for patients and increase their chance of survival, whether or not specific treatments are being used.

{"title": "E. coli", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ) is a bacterium that is commonly found in the gut of humans and warm-blooded animals. Most strains of  E. coli  are harmless. Some strains however, such as Shiga toxin-producing  E. coli  (STEC), can cause severe foodborne disease. It is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated foods, such as raw or undercooked ground meat products, raw milk, and contaminated raw vegetables and sprouts.  STEC produces toxins, known as Shiga-toxins because of their similarity to the toxins produced by Shigella dysenteriae. STEC can grow in temperatures ranging from 7 °C to 50 °C, with an optimum temperature of 37 °C. Some STEC can grow in acidic foods, down to a pH of 4.4, and in foods with a minimum water activity (a W ) of 0.95.  STEC is destroyed by thorough cooking of foods until all parts reach a temperature of 70 °C or higher.  E. coli  O157:H7 is the most important STEC serotype in relation to public health; however, other serotypes have frequently been involved in sporadic cases and outbreaks. Symptoms of the diseases caused by STEC include abdominal cramps and diarrhoea that may in some cases progress to bloody diarrhoea (haemorrhagic colitis). Fever and vomiting may also occur. The incubation period can range from 3 to 8 days, with a median of 3 to 4 days. Most patients recover within 10 days, but in a small proportion of patients (particularly young children and the elderly), the infection may lead to a life-threatening disease, such as haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). HUS is characterized by acute renal failure, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets). It is estimated that up to 10% of patients with STEC infection may develop HUS, with a case-fatality rate ranging from 3 to 5%. Overall, HUS is the most common cause of acute renal failure in young children. It can cause neurological complications (such as seizure, stroke and coma) in 25% of HUS patients and chronic renal sequelae, usually mild, in around 50% of survivors. Persons who experience bloody diarrhoea or severe abdominal cramps should seek medical care. Antibiotics are not part of the treatment of patients with STEC disease and may possibly increase the risk of subsequent HUS. Most available information on STEC relates to serotype O157:H7, since it is easily differentiated biochemically from other  E. coli  strains. The reservoir of this pathogen appears to be mainly cattle. In addition, other ruminants such as sheep, goats, deer are considered significant reservoirs, while other mammals (such as pigs, horses, rabbits, dogs, and cats) and birds (such as chickens and turkeys) have been found infected.  E. coli  O157:H7 is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated foods, such as raw or undercooked ground meat products and raw milk. Faecal contamination of water and other foods, as well as cross-contamination during food preparation (with beef and other meat products, contaminated surfaces and kitchen utensils), will also lead to infection. Examples of foods implicated in outbreaks of  E. coli  O157:H7 include undercooked hamburgers, dried cured salami, unpasteurized fresh-pressed apple cider, yogurt, and cheese made from raw milk.  An increasing number of outbreaks are associated with the consumption of fruits and vegetables (including sprouts, spinach, lettuce, coleslaw, and salad) whereby contamination may be due to contact with faeces from domestic or wild animals at some stage during cultivation or handling. STEC has also been isolated from bodies of water (such as ponds and streams), wells and water troughs, and has been found to survive for months in manure and water-trough sediments. Waterborne transmission has been reported, both from contaminated drinking-water and from recreational waters. Person-to-person contact is an important mode of transmission through the oral-faecal route. An asymptomatic carrier state has been reported, where individuals show no clinical signs of disease but are capable of infecting others. The duration of excretion of STEC is about 1 week or less in adults but can be longer in children. Visiting farms and other venues where the general public might come into direct contact with farm animals has also been identified as an important risk factor for STEC infection. The prevention of infection requires control measures at all stages of the food chain, from agricultural production on the farm to processing, manufacturing and preparation of foods in both commercial establishments and household kitchens. The number of cases of disease might be reduced by various mitigation strategies for ground beef (for example, screening the animals pre-slaughter to reduce the introduction of large numbers of pathogens in the slaughtering environment). Good hygienic slaughtering practices reduce contamination of carcasses by faeces but do not guarantee the absence of STEC from products. Education in hygienic handling of foods for workers at farms, abattoirs and those involved in the food production is essential to keep microbiological contamination to a minimum. The only effective method of eliminating STEC from foods is to introduce a bactericidal treatment, such as heating (for example, cooking or pasteurization) or irradiation.  Preventive measures for  E. coli  O157:H7 infection are similar to those recommended for other foodborne diseases. Basic good food hygiene practices, as described in the WHO “ Five keys to safer food ”, can prevent the transmission of pathogens responsible for many foodborne diseases, and also protect against foodborne diseases caused by STEC.  The five keys to safer food are: Such recommendations should in all cases be implemented, especially \"cook thoroughly\" so that the centre of the food reaches at least 70 °C. Make sure to wash fruits and vegetables carefully, especially if they are eaten raw. If possible, vegetables and fruits should be peeled. Vulnerable populations (such as small children and the elderly) should avoid the consumption of raw or undercooked meat products, raw milk, and products made from raw milk. Regular handwashing, particularly before food preparation or consumption and after toilet contact, is highly recommended, especially for people who take care of small children, the elderly or immunocompromised individuals, as the bacterium can be passed from person to person, as well as through food, water and direct contact with animals. A number of STEC infections have been caused by contact with recreational water. Therefore, it is also important to protect such water areas, as well as drinking-water sources, from animal waste (4). WHO’s \" Five keys to growing safer fruits and vegetables \" provides rural workers who grow fresh fruits and vegetables for themselves, their families and for sale in local markets, with key practices to prevent microbial contamination of fresh produces during planting, growing, harvesting and storing.  The five keys to growing safer fruits and vegetables are: WHO provides scientific assessments to control STEC in food. These assessments serve as the basis for international food standards, guidelines, and recommendations developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. WHO promotes the strengthening of food safety systems by promoting good manufacturing practices and educating retailers and consumers about appropriate food handling and avoiding contamination. During  E. coli  outbreaks, such as those in Europe in 2011, WHO supports the coordination of information sharing and collaboration through International Health Regulations and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) worldwide. WHO works closely with national health authorities and international partners, providing technical assistance and the latest information on outbreaks.", "Symptoms": "Symptoms of the diseases caused by STEC include abdominal cramps and diarrhoea that may in some cases progress to bloody diarrhoea (haemorrhagic colitis).

The number of cases of disease might be reduced by various mitigation strategies for ground beef (for example, screening the animals pre-slaughter to reduce the introduction of large numbers of pathogens in the slaughtering environment). Good hygienic slaughtering practices reduce contamination of carcasses by faeces but do not guarantee the absence of STEC from products. Education in hygienic handling of foods for workers at farms, abattoirs and those involved in the food production is essential to keep microbiological contamination to a minimum. The only effective method of eliminating STEC from foods is to introduce a bactericidal treatment, such as heating (for example, cooking or pasteurization) or irradiation.  Preventive measures for  E. coli  O157:H7 infection are similar to those recommended for other foodborne diseases. Basic good food hygiene practices, as described in the WHO “ Five keys to safer food ”, can prevent the transmission of pathogens responsible for many foodborne diseases, and also protect against foodborne diseases caused by STEC.  The five keys to safer food are: Such recommendations should in all cases be implemented, especially \"cook thoroughly\" so that the centre of the food reaches at least 70 °C. Make sure to wash fruits and vegetables carefully, especially if they are eaten raw. If possible, vegetables and fruits should be peeled. Vulnerable populations (such as small children and the elderly) should avoid the consumption of raw or undercooked meat products, raw milk, and products made from raw milk. Regular handwashing, particularly before food preparation or consumption and after toilet contact, is highly recommended, especially for people who take care of small children, the elderly or immunocompromised individuals, as the bacterium can be passed from person to person, as well as through food, water and direct contact with animals. A number of STEC infections have been caused by contact with recreational water. Therefore, it is also important to protect such water areas, as well as drinking-water sources, from animal waste (4). WHO’s \" Five keys to growing safer fruits and vegetables \" provides rural workers who grow fresh fruits and vegetables for themselves, their families and for sale in local markets, with key practices to prevent microbial contamination of fresh produces during planting, growing, harvesting and storing.  The five keys to growing safer fruits and vegetables are: WHO provides scientific assessments to control STEC in food. These assessments serve as the basis for international food standards, guidelines, and recommendations developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. WHO promotes the strengthening of food safety systems by promoting good manufacturing practices and educating retailers and consumers about appropriate food handling and avoiding contamination. During  E. coli  outbreaks, such as those in Europe in 2011, WHO supports the coordination of information sharing and collaboration through International Health Regulations and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) worldwide.

{"title": "Diarrhoeal disease", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Diarrhoeal disease is the third leading cause of death in children under 5 years old and is responsible for killing around 443 832 children every year. Diarrhoea can last several days and can leave the body without the water and salts that are necessary for survival. In the past, for most people, severe dehydration and fluid loss were the main causes of diarrhoea-associated deaths. Now, other causes such as septic bacterial infections are likely to account for an increasing proportion of all diarrhoea-associated deaths. Children who are malnourished or have impaired immunity, as well as people living with HIV, are most at risk of life-threatening diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual). Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhoea, nor is the passing of loose, pasty stools by breastfed babies.  Diarrhoea is usually a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene.  Interventions to prevent diarrhoea, including safe drinking-water, use of improved sanitation and hand washing with soap, can reduce disease risk. Diarrhoea should be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS), a solution of clean water, sugar and salt. In addition, a 10–14 day supplemental treatment course of dispersible zinc tablets shortens diarrhoea duration and improves outcomes. There are 3 clinical types of diarrhoea: Diarrhoeal disease is a leading cause of child mortality and morbidity in the world, and mostly results from contaminated food and water sources. Worldwide, 780 million individuals lack access to improved drinking-water and 2.5 billion lack improved sanitation. Diarrhoea due to infection is widespread throughout developing countries. In low-income countries, children under 3 years old experience on average three episodes of diarrhoea every year. Each episode deprives the child of the nutrition necessary for growth. As a result, diarrhoea is a major cause of malnutrition, and malnourished children are more likely to fall ill from diarrhoea. The most severe threat posed by diarrhoea is dehydration. During a diarrhoeal episode, water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium and bicarbonate) are lost through liquid stools, vomit, sweat, urine and breathing. Dehydration occurs when these losses are not replaced. The degree of dehydration is rated on a scale of 3. Infection:  Diarrhoea is a symptom of infections caused by a host of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms, most of which are spread by faeces-contaminated water. Infection is more common when there is a shortage of adequate sanitation and hygiene and safe water for drinking, cooking and cleaning. Among children under 5 years of age, the most common viral pathogens are rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus and astrovirus. Bacterial pathogens include  Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Campylobacter spp. , while parasitic pathogens include  Cryptosporidium ,  Giardia , and  Entamoeba spp . Rotavirus and  E. coli  are the most common pathogens among children across all age groups, while parasitic pathogens, are prevalent in children aged 3–5 years. Bacterial pathogens, including  E. coli ,  Salmonella , and  Shigella , were common in the children age 6 to 10-year age group, as were rotavirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. Location-specific etiologic patterns also need to be considered. Malnutrition:  Children who die from diarrhoea often suffer from underlying malnutrition, which makes them more vulnerable to diarrhoea. Each diarrhoeal episode, in turn, makes their malnutrition even worse. Diarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under 5 years old. Source:  Water contaminated with human faeces, for example from sewage, septic tanks and latrines, is of particular concern. Animal faeces also contain microorganisms that can cause diarrhoea.

More than half (59%) of adults aged 30 years and over living with diabetes were not taking medication for their diabetes in 2022. Diabetes treatment coverage was lowest in low- and middle-income countries. In 2021, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.6 million deaths and 47% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. Another 530 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and high blood glucose causes around 11% of cardiovascular deaths  (1) . Since 2000, mortality rates from diabetes have been increasing. By contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 20% globally between 2000 and 2019. \r\n Symptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly. In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and may take many years to be noticed. Symptoms of diabetes include:  Over time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nerves. People with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failure. Diabetes can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyes. Many people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow. This can cause foot ulcers and may lead to amputation. Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin. In 2017 there were 9 million people with type 1 diabetes; the majority of them live in high-income countries. Neither its cause nor the means to prevent it are known. Type 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy. It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated.  Over time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood vessels. Type 2 diabetes is often preventable. Factors that contribute to developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight, not getting enough exercise, and genetics.  Early diagnosis is important to prevent the worst effects of type 2 diabetes. The best way to detect diabetes early is to get regular check-ups and blood tests with a healthcare provider.  Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be mild. They may take several years to be noticed.  Symptoms may be similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen. More than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes was formerly called non-insulin dependent, or adult onset. Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but it is now also occurring increasingly frequently in children. Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy. Women with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and at delivery. These women and possibly their children are also at increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the future. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than through reported symptoms. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) are intermediate conditions in the transition between normality and diabetes. People with IGT or IFG are at high risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes, although this is not inevitable. Lifestyle changes are the best way to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. To help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should:  Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood glucose. People with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for survival. One of the most important ways to treat diabetes is to keep a healthy lifestyle.  Some people with type 2 diabetes will need to take medicines to help manage their blood sugar levels. These can include insulin injections or other medicines. Some examples include:  Along with medicines to lower blood sugar, people with diabetes often need medications to lower their blood pressure and statins to reduce the risk of complications.  Additional medical care may be needed to treat the effects of diabetes: WHO aims to stimulate and support the adoption of effective measures for the surveillance, prevention and control of diabetes and its complications, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. To this end, WHO: In April 2021 WHO launched the Global Diabetes Compact, a global initiative aiming for sustained improvements in diabetes prevention and care, with a particular focus on supporting low- and middle-income countries.  In May 2021, the World Health Assembly agreed a Resolution on strengthening prevention and control of diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes was formerly called non-insulin dependent, or adult onset. Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but it is now also occurring increasingly frequently in children. Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy. Women with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and at delivery. These women and possibly their children are also at increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the future. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than through reported symptoms. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) are intermediate conditions in the transition between normality and diabetes. People with IGT or IFG are at high risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes, although this is not inevitable. Lifestyle changes are the best way to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. To help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should:  Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood glucose. People with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for survival. One of the most important ways to treat diabetes is to keep a healthy lifestyle.  Some people with type 2 diabetes will need to take medicines to help manage their blood sugar levels. These can include insulin injections or other medicines. Some examples include:  Along with medicines to lower blood sugar, people with diabetes often need medications to lower their blood pressure and statins to reduce the risk of complications.  Additional medical care may be needed to treat the effects of diabetes: WHO aims to stimulate and support the adoption of effective measures for the surveillance, prevention and control of diabetes and its complications, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. To this end, WHO: In April 2021 WHO launched the Global Diabetes Compact, a global initiative aiming for sustained improvements in diabetes prevention and care, with a particular focus on supporting low- and middle-income countries.  In May 2021, the World Health Assembly agreed a Resolution on strengthening prevention and control of diabetes. In May 2022 the World Health Assembly endorsed five global diabetes coverage targets to be achieved by 2030.

In 2017 there were 9 million people with type 1 diabetes; the majority of them live in high-income countries. Neither its cause nor the means to prevent it are known. Type 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy. It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated.  Over time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood vessels. Type 2 diabetes is often preventable.

{"title": "Depressive disorder (depression)", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Overview Depressive disorder (also known as depression) is a common mental disorder. It involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time. Depression is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life. It can affect all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community. It can result from or lead to problems at school and at work. Depression can happen to anyone. People who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other stressful events are more likely to develop depression. Women are more likely to have depression than men. An estimated 4% of the population experience depression, including 5.7% of adults (4.6% among men and 6.9% among women), and 5.9% of adults aged 70 years and older. Approximately 332 million people in the world have depression  (1) . Depression is about 1.5 times more common among women than among men. Worldwide, more than 10% of pregnant women and women who have just given birth experience depression  (2) . In 2021, an estimated 727 000 people lost their lives to suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death in 15–29-year-olds. In high-income countries, only about one third of people with depression receive mental health treatment  (3) .  Barriers to effective care include a lack of investment in mental health care, lack of trained health-care providers and social stigma associated with mental disorders.  During a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty). They may feel a loss of pleasure or interest in activities. A depressive episode is different from regular mood fluctuations. They last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. Other symptoms are also present, which may include: Depression can cause difficulties in all aspects of life, including in the community and at home, work and school. A depressive episode can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe depending on the number and severity of symptoms, as well as the impact on the individual’s functioning.  There are different patterns of depressive episodes including: Depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. People who have gone through adverse life events (unemployment, bereavement, traumatic events) are more likely to develop depression. Depression can, in turn, lead to more stress and dysfunction and worsen the affected person’s life situation and the depression itself. Depression is closely related to and affected by physical health. Many of the factors that influence depression (such as physical inactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and respiratory diseases. In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing depression due to the difficulties associated with managing their condition. Prevention programmes have been shown to reduce depression. Effective community approaches to prevent depression include school-based programmes to enhance a pattern of positive coping in children and adolescents. Interventions for parents of children with behavioural problems may reduce parental depressive symptoms and improve outcomes for their children. Exercise programmes for older persons can also be effective in depression prevention. There are effective treatments for depression. These include psychological treatment and medications. Seek care if you have symptoms of depression. Psychological treatments are the first treatments for depression. They can be combined with antidepressant medications in moderate and severe depression. Antidepressant medications are not needed for mild depression. Psychological treatments can teach new ways of thinking, coping or relating to others. They may include talk therapy with professionals and supervised lay therapists. Talk therapy can happen in person or online. Psychological treatments may be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps.  Effective psychological treatments for depression include:    Antidepressant medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine. Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, and/or treatment availability), and individual preferences.  Antidepressants should not be used for treating depression in children and are not the first line of treatment in adolescents, among whom they should be used with extra caution. Different medications and treatments are used for bipolar disorder.  Self-care can play an important role in managing symptoms of depression and promoting overall well-being. What you can do: If you have thoughts of suicide: If you think you are in immediate danger of harming yourself, contact any available emergency services or a crisis line. WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030  highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental disorders including depression.  Depression and self-harm/suicide are among the priority conditions covered by WHO’s  Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP).  The Programme aims to help countries increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders through care provided by health workers who are not specialists in mental health.  WHO has developed brief psychological intervention manuals for depression that may be delivered by lay therapists to individuals and groups. An example is the   Problem Management Plus (PM+) manual , which describes the use of behavioural activation, stress management, problem solving treatment and strengthening social support. Moreover, the  Group Interpersonal Therapy for Depression manual  describes group treatment of depression. Finally, the   Thinking Healthy manual  covers the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy for perinatal depression.   References 1. 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) [online database].

{"title": "Dengue", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Dengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that is spread from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical than in temperate climates. Most people who get dengue do not have symptoms. For those who do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash. Most get better in 1–2 weeks. Some develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital.  In severe cases, dengue can be fatal.   You can lower your risk of dengue by avoiding mosquito bites, especially during the day. Dengue is treated through pain management as there is no specific treatment currently. Most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1–2 weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death.   If symptoms occur, they usually begin 4–10 days after infection and last for 2–7 days. Symptoms may include: Individuals who are infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue. The symptoms of severe dengue  often come after the fever has gone away and may include: People with these severe symptoms should seek care immediately.   After recovery, people who have had dengue may experience fatigue for several weeks. Laboratory-based and point of care diagnostics are critical to control and manage dengue, yet global disparities in laboratory capabilities present significant challenges. The diagnostic algorithms, testing strategies and test methodologies employed vary, depending on the capabilities of national laboratory systems. The wide range of available tests – including nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) –  vary significantly in quality and performance. Laboratory testing for arboviruses can be accomplished through either direct detection methods such as virus isolation, molecular detection of nucleic acid or antigen testing, including rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) within the first week of illness. There is no specific treatment for dengue, although pain can be managed with medication such as paracetamol (acetaminophen). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen and aspirin should be avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding. Global burden The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically worldwide in recent decades, with the number of cases reported to WHO increasing from 505 430 cases in 2000 to 14.6 million in 2024. The vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-managed, and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are under-reported. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries. In 2024, more cases of dengue were recorded than ever before in a 12-month period, affecting over 100 countries on all continents. During 2024, ongoing transmission, combined with an unexpected spike in dengue cases, resulted in a historic high of over 14.6 million cases and more than 12 000 dengue-related deaths reported. The Region of the Americas contributed a significant proportion of the global burden, with over 13 million cases reported to WHO.  Several factors are associated with the increasing risk of spread of the dengue epidemic, including the changing distribution of the responsible vectors (chiefly  Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ), especially in previously dengue-naive countries; climate change leading to increasing temperatures, high rainfall and humidity; fragile and overburdened health systems; limitations in surveillance and reporting; and political and financial instabilities in countries facing complex humanitarian crises and high population movements.  One modelling estimate indicates 390 million dengue virus infections per year, of which 96 million manifest clinically(1). A recent study on the prevalence of dengue estimates that 5.6 billion people are at risk of infection with dengue and other arboviruses(2). Dengue is spreading to new areas, including the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions. In 2024, 308 cases were reported to WHO from three European countries (France, Italy and Spain) and an additional 1291 cases and four deaths were recorded in the French overseas territories of Mayotte and Réunion.  Transmission The dengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the  Aedes aegypti  mosquito. Other species within the  Aedes  genus can also act as vectors, but their contribution is normally secondary to  Aedes aegypti .  After feeding on a DENV-infected person, the virus replicates in the mosquito midgut before disseminating to secondary tissues, including the salivary glands. The time it takes from ingesting the virus to actual transmission to a new host is termed the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). The EIP takes about 8–12 days when the ambient temperature is 25–28°C. Variations in the EIP are not only influenced by ambient temperature but also by several other factors – such as the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuations, the virus genotype, and the initial viral concentration – which can also alter the time it takes for a mosquito to transmit the virus. Once infectious, a mosquito can transmit the virus for the rest of its life. Mosquitoes can become infected by people who are viremic with DENV. This can be someone who has a symptomatic dengue infection, someone who is yet to have a symptomatic infection (those who are pre-symptomatic), and also someone who shows no signs of illness (those who are asymptomatic). Human-to-mosquito transmission can occur up to 2 days before someone shows symptoms of the illness, and up to 2 days after the fever has resolved. The risk of mosquito infection is positively associated with high viremia and high fever in the patient; conversely, high levels of DENV-specific antibodies are associated with a decreased risk of mosquito infection. Most people are viremic for about 4–5 days, but viremia can last as long as 12 days. The primary mode of transmission of the DENV between humans involves mosquito vectors. There is evidence, however, of the possibility of maternal transmission (i.e. from a pregnant mother to her baby). At the same time, vertical transmission rates appear low, with the risk of vertical transmission seemingly linked to the timing of acquiring the dengue infection during pregnancy. When a mother does have a dengue infection when she is pregnant, babies may suffer from pre-term birth, low birthweight and fetal distress. Rare cases of transmission via blood products, organ donation and transfusions have been recorded. Similarly, transovarial transmission of the virus within mosquitoes has also been recorded.  Previous infection with DENV increases the risk of an individual developing severe dengue. Urbanization (especially rapid, unplanned urbanization), is associated with dengue transmission through multiple social and environmental factors: population density, human mobility, access to reliable water source, water storage practices, etc. Community risks to dengue also depend on population knowledge, attitudes and practices towards dengue, as exposure is closely related to behaviours such as water storage, plant-keeping and self-protection against mosquito bites. Routine vector surveillance and control activities and targeted community engagement greatly enhance resilience.  Vectors can adapt to new environments and climate. The interaction between the dengue virus, the host and the environment is dynamic. Consequently, disease risks may change and shift with climate change in tropical and subtropical areas, in combination with increased urbanization and population movement. The mosquitoes that spread dengue are active during the day.  To lower your risk of getting dengue, protect yourself from mosquito bites by using:  To prevent mosquitoes from breeding: If you get dengue, it’s important to: Currently, one vaccine (QDenga) is available and licensed in some countries. However, it is recommended only for those aged 6–16 years in high transmission settings. Several additional vaccines are under evaluation.

{"title": "Dementia", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Dementia is a term for several diseases that affect memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily activities.  The illness gets worse over time. It mainly affects older people but not all people will get it as they age. Things that increase the risk of developing dementia include: Dementia is a syndrome that can be caused by a number of diseases which over time destroy nerve cells and damage the brain, typically leading to deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought) beyond what might be expected from the usual consequences of biological ageing. While consciousness is not affected, the impairment in cognitive function is commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by changes in mood, emotional control, behaviour, or motivation. Dementia has physical, psychological, social and economic impacts, not only for people living with dementia, but also for their carers, families and society at large. There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care. Changes in mood and behaviour sometimes happen even before memory problems occur. Symptoms get worse over time. Eventually, most people with dementia will need others to help with daily activities.  Early signs and symptoms are: Common changes in mood and behaviour include: Dementia affects each person in a different way, depending upon the underlying causes, other health conditions and the person’s cognitive functioning before becoming ill.  Most symptoms become worse over time, while others might disappear or only occur in the later stages of dementia. As the disease progresses, the need for help with personal care increases. People with dementia may not be able to recognize family members or friends, develop difficulties moving around, lose control over their bladder and bowels, have trouble eating and drinking and experience behaviour changes such as aggression that are distressing to the person with dementia as well as those around them. Dementia is caused by many different diseases or injuries that directly and indirectly damage the brain. Alzheimer disease is the most common form and may contribute to 60–70% of cases. Other forms include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (abnormal deposits of protein inside nerve cells), and a group of diseases that contribute to frontotemporal dementia (degeneration of the frontal lobe of the brain). Dementia may also develop after a stroke or in the context of certain infections such as HIV, as a result of harmful use of alcohol, repetitive physical injuries to the brain (known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy) or nutritional deficiencies. The boundaries between different forms of dementia are indistinct and mixed forms often co-exist. There is no cure for dementia, but a lot can be done to support both people living with the illness and those who care for them. People with dementia can take steps to maintain their quality of life and promote their well-being by: In addition, some medications can help manage dementia symptoms: If people living with dementia are at risk of hurting themselves or others, medicines like haloperidol and risperidone can help, but these should never be used as the first treatment For those diagnosed with dementia, there are things that can help manage symptoms: Plan ahead of time. Over time, it may be harder to make important decisions for yourself or your finances: It is important to recognize that providing care and support for a person living with dementia can be challenging, impacting the carer’s own health and well-being. As someone supporting a person living with dementia, reach out to family members, friends, and professionals for help. Take regular breaks and look after yourself. Try stress management techniques such as mindfulness-based exercises and seek professional help and guidance if needed. Although age is the strongest known risk factor for dementia, it is not an inevitable consequence of biological ageing. Further, dementia does not exclusively affect older people – young onset dementia (defined as the onset of symptoms before the age of 65 years) accounts for up to 9% of cases. Studies show that people can reduce their risk of cognitive decline and dementia by  being physically active , not smoking,  avoiding harmful use of alcohol , controlling their weight, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Additional risk factors include depression, social isolation, low educational attainment, cognitive inactivity and  air pollution . Unfortunately, people living with dementia are frequently denied the basic rights and freedoms available to others. In many countries, physical and chemical restraints are used extensively in care homes for older people and in acute-care settings, even when regulations are in place to uphold the rights of people to freedom and choice. An appropriate and supportive legislative environment based on internationally-accepted human rights standards is required to ensure the highest quality of care for people with dementia and their carers. WHO recognizes dementia as a public health priority. In May 2017, the World Health Assembly endorsed the  Global action plan on the public health response to dementia 2017-2025 . The Plan provides a comprehensive blueprint for action – for policy-makers, international, regional and national partners, and WHO in the following areas: addressing dementia as a public health priority; increasing awareness of dementia and creating a dementia-inclusive society; reducing the risk of dementia; diagnosis, treatment and care; information systems for dementia; support for dementia carers; and, research and innovation To facilitate the monitoring of the global dementia action plan, WHO developed the  Global Dementia Observatory  (GDO), a data portal that collates country data on 35 key dementia indicators across the global action plan’s seven strategic areas. As a complement to the GDO, WHO launched the  GDO Knowledge Exchange Platform , which is a repository of good practices examples in the area of dementia with the goal of fostering mutual learning and multi-directional exchange between regions, countries and individuals to facilitate action globally.", "Signs and symptoms": "Changes in mood and behaviour sometimes happen even before memory problems occur.

Alzheimer disease is the most common form and may contribute to 60–70% of cases. Other forms include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (abnormal deposits of protein inside nerve cells), and a group of diseases that contribute to frontotemporal dementia (degeneration of the frontal lobe of the brain). Dementia may also develop after a stroke or in the context of certain infections such as HIV, as a result of harmful use of alcohol, repetitive physical injuries to the brain (known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy) or nutritional deficiencies.

{"title": "Deafness and hearing loss", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Over 5% of the world’s population – or 430 million people – require rehabilitation to address their disabling hearing loss (including 34 million children). It is estimated that by 2050 over 700 million people –\r\n    or 1 in every 10 people – will have disabling hearing loss. Disabling hearing loss refers to hearing loss greater than 35 decibels (dB) in the better hearing ear. Nearly 80% of people with disabling hearing loss live in low- and middle-income countries. The prevalence of hearing loss increases\r\n    with age, among those older than 60 years, over 25% are affected by disabling hearing loss. A person who is not able to hear as well as someone with normal hearing – hearing thresholds of 20 dB or better in both ears – is said to have hearing loss. Hearing loss may be mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound. It can affect one ear or both ears and leads to difficulty in hearing conversational speech or loud sounds. Hard of hearing refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe. People who are hard of hearing usually communicate through spoken language and can benefit from hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other assistive devices as well as captioning. Deaf people mostly have profound hearing loss, which implies very little or no hearing. They can benefit from cochlear implants. Some of them use sign language for communication. Although these factors can be encountered at different periods across the life span, individuals are most susceptible to their effects during critical periods in life.  When unaddressed, hearing loss impacts many aspects of life at individual level: Many of the causes that lead to hearing loss can be avoided through public health strategies and clinical interventions implemented across the life course.  Prevention of hearing loss is essential throughout the life course, from prenatal and perinatal periods to older age. In children, nearly 60% of hearing loss is due to avoidable causes that can be prevented through implementation of public health\r\n    measures. Likewise, most common causes of hearing loss in adults, such as exposure to loud sounds and ototoxic medicines, are preventable. Effective strategies for reducing hearing loss at different stages of the life course include:  Early identification of hearing loss and ear diseases is key to effective management. This requires systematic screening for detection of hearing loss and related ear diseases in those who are most at risk. This includes:  Hearing assessment and ear examination can be conducted in clinical and community settings. Tools such as the  hearWHO app  and other technology-based solutions make it possible to screen for ear diseases and hearing loss with\r\n    limited training and resources.   Once hearing loss is identified, it is essential that it is addressed as early as possible and in an appropriate manner, to mitigate any adverse impact.  Rehabilitation helps people with hearing loss to function at their optimum, which means they can be as independent as possible in everyday activities. Specifically, rehabilitation helps them to participate in education, work, recreation and meaningful roles, for example in their families or communities, throughout their lives. Interventions for rehabilitation for people with hearing loss include:  WHO’s work on ear and hearing care is to promote integrated people-centred ear and hearing care (IPC-EHC).

{"title": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads through the air in infectious respiratory particles from an infected person. Transmission is more likely in close contact or shared indoor spaces. The virus can also spread by touching contaminated surfaces and then the eyes, nose or mouth.  Because of increasing immunity from past infections and/or vaccination, most people recover without treatment. About 6% develop post COVID-19 condition (PCC, or long COVID), however, which can cause lasting symptoms such as memory issues, fatigue or breathing difficulties. PCC an affect daily life and requires individualized care.  Older adults, people with underlying health conditions, and unvaccinated individuals are at higher risk of severe illness. Conditions that increase risk include diabetes, health or lung disease, obesity and weakened immune systems.  Health and care workers face higher exposure risk due to their work environment.  Vaccination remains a key preventive measure against severe disease. COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide strong protection against severe illness and death. Symptoms People may experience different symptoms with COVID-19.  The most common symptoms are: Less common symptoms are: Immediate medical attention should be sought by people at risk of developing severe disease or with the following severe symptoms: People who have underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing severe disease when they have COVID-19; they should seek medical help early if worried about their condition. These include: The potential consequences of severe COVID-19 include respiratory failure, sepsis, thromboembolism (blood clots), and multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys, and death. In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection and may require medical attention and hospitalization.  Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms long after the infectious period has ended. These long-term effects are called post COVID-19 condition (PCC, or long COVID). The most common symptoms  include fatigue, aches and pains in muscles or joints, breathlessness, headaches, and difficulty in thinking or concentrating. Post COVID-19 condition can affect a person’s ability to perform daily activities such as work or household tasks.   SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, spreads through the air via infectious respiratory particles released when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs, or sneezes. People are more likely to catch the virus when they are close to the infected person, or when they are sharing a closed space with them. The virus can also enter the body when someone touches contaminated surfaces like doorknobs or handles and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth. SARS-CoV-2 circulates throughout the year, causing outbreaks worldwide without an established seasonal pattern.  Symptoms usually begin 3-6 days* after exposure (1) and last up to10 days, with some individuals experiencing symptoms for a longer period. Infected people may also spread the virus in the absence of symptoms or in the days prior to developing any symptoms. Medical treatment exists for COVID-19, although most people recover from mild illness without needing treatment. For those who need treatment, health-care professionals suggest treatments for COVID-19 based on the severity of the disease and the risk of it getting worse. They consider the person’s age, symptoms, any coexisting health conditions, and individual factors which might interfere with specific treatments. There are a number of things that people can do to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These are: Those providing care for high-risk individuals should wear a medical mask and test for COVID-19 if they develop any of the symptoms of COVID-19.  There are a number of things that can be done to avoid becoming sick with COVID-19:  These are:  To prevent severe illness, hospitalization and death due to COVID-19, vaccination should be considered, particularly if you are at higher risk of serious illness, or if you are a health and care worker caring for those at higher risk.

Since their introduction, COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives around the world by providing protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. In November 2023, given that most of the global population had by that time been infected at least once, WHO updated its recommendations stating that a single dose of vaccine can be considered for those who have not yet been vaccinated. Revaccination against COVID-19 may be needed 6-12 months after the most recent dose for high priority groups such as older adults; individuals with severe obesity or multiple significant comorbidities, including diabetes, chronic lung diseases, heart, liver and kidney diseases; persons with immunocompromising conditions; pregnant women and health and care workers with direct patient contact.

During the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO coordinated the global response, supporting countries with preparedness, surveillance, diagnostics, clinical care, medical countermeasures, access to oxygen, country readiness and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine safety monitoring, and evidence-based guidance. WHO recommended 13 vaccines for emergency use, guiding countries and UN agencies in their procurement, and led global coordination on research and development, and setting standards for vaccines, tests, and treatments.

Since the Director-General of WHO lifted the Public Health Emergency of International Concern in May 2023 and the  emergency phase ended , WHO has continued to lead the global COVID-19 response, working with governments and partners to shift from emergency measures to long-term, integrated management of COVID-19 and other coronavirus threats. Ongoing activities in this respect include regular issuance of  Disease Outbreak News posts, supporting ongoing research, updating guidance, monitoring virus trends, and evaluating vaccine composition.  To guide this shift, WHO has developed a  strategic and operational plan  to help countries manage COVID-19 as part of routine health systems. The plan promotes sustainable, evidence-based management of coronavirus threats, aligning COVID-19 responses with broader strategies for respiratory disease control and public health resilience.  ---  --- Reference 1.

People are more likely to catch the virus when they are close to the infected person, or when they are sharing a closed space with them. The virus can also enter the body when someone touches contaminated surfaces like doorknobs or handles and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth. SARS-CoV-2 circulates throughout the year, causing outbreaks worldwide without an established seasonal pattern.  Symptoms usually begin 3-6 days* after exposure (1) and last up to10 days, with some individuals experiencing symptoms for a longer period. Infected people may also spread the virus in the absence of symptoms or in the days prior to developing any symptoms. Medical treatment exists for COVID-19, although most people recover from mild illness without needing treatment. For those who need treatment, health-care professionals suggest treatments for COVID-19 based on the severity of the disease and the risk of it getting worse. They consider the person’s age, symptoms, any coexisting health conditions, and individual factors which might interfere with specific treatments.

{"title": "Congenital disorders", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Congenital disorders are also known as congenital abnormalities, congenital malformations or birth defects. They can be defined as structural or functional anomalies (for example, metabolic disorders) that occur during intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally, at birth, or sometimes may only be detected later in infancy, such as hearing defects. Broadly, congenital refers to the existence at or before birth.  The proportion of under-5 deaths due to congenital disorders increases as other causes of under-5 deaths are controlled (fig. 1). \r\n Fig 1:  Changes in causes of under 5 deaths as under 5 mortality rates decline Genetic  A minority of congenital disorders are caused by genetic abnormalities i.e. chromosomal abnormalities (for example Down syndrome or trisomy 21) or single gene defects (for example cystic fibrosis).  Consanguinity (when parents are related by blood) also increases the prevalence of rare genetic congenital disorders and nearly doubles the risk for neonatal and childhood death, intellectual disability and other anomalies. Low-income may be an indirect determinant of congenital disorders, with a higher frequency among resource-constrained families and countries. It is estimated that about 94% of severe congenital disorders occur in low- and middle-income countries. An indirect determinant, this higher risk relates to a possible lack of access to sufficient nutritious foods by pregnant women, an increased exposure to agents or factors such as infection and alcohol, or poorer access to health care and screening. Maternal age is also a risk factor for abnormal intrauterine fetal development. Advanced maternal age increases the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome. Environmental factors including infections Others occur because of environmental factors like maternal infections (syphilis, rubella, Zika), exposure to radiation, certain pollutants, maternal nutritional deficiencies (e.g., iodine, folate deficiency), illness (maternal diabetes) or certain drugs\r\n    (alcohol, phenytoin).  Unknown causes While complex genetic and environmental interactions are proposed, most congenital disorders have unknown causes, including congenital heart defects, cleft lip or palate and club foot.  Preventive public health measures work to decrease the frequency of certain congenital disorders through the removal of risk factors or the reinforcement of protective factors. Important interventions and efforts include: Screening  Health care before and near conception (preconception and peri-conception) includes basic reproductive health practices, as well as medical genetic screening and counselling. Screening can be conducted during the 3 periods listed: This can be useful to identify those at risk of specific disorders or of passing a disorder onto their children. Screening includes obtaining family histories and carrier screening and is particularly valuable in countries where consanguineous marriage\r\n    is common. Maternal characteristics may increase risk, and screening results should be used to offer appropriate care, according to risk. This may include screening for young or advanced maternal age, as well as screening for use of alcohol, tobacco or other risks.\r\n    Ultrasound can be used to screen for Down syndrome and major structural abnormalities during the first trimester, and for severe fetal anomalies during the second trimester. Maternal blood can be screened for placental markers to aid in prediction\r\n    of risk of chromosomal abnormalities or neural tube defects, or for free fetal DNA to screen for many chromosomal abnormalities. Diagnostic tests such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis can be used to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities\r\n    and infections in women at high risk. Screening of newborns is an important step towards detection. This helps to reduce mortality and morbidity from congenital disorders by facilitating earlier referral and the initiation of medial or surgical treatment. Early screening for hearing loss provides an opportunity for early correction and allows the possibility of acquiring better language, speech and communication skills. Early screening of newborns for congenital cataract also allows early referral and\r\n    surgical correction which increases the likelihood of sight. Newborns may be screened for certain metabolic, hematologic and endocrine disorders, many of which may not have immediately visible effects. The conditions screened for vary by country, depending on prevalence and cost. Newborn screening is increasingly\r\n    conducted even in low- and middle-income countries.  Treatment and care Some congenital disorders can be treated with medical or surgical interventions. Access to this care may vary by country and by different levels of a health system, though complex care is increasingly available in low- and middle-income settings.  Surgery with good follow up care can often mitigate the potential lethality (as in the case of congenital heart defects) or the morbidity (e.g., congenital talipes, cleft lip/palate) associated with structural congenital disorders. The contribution to reducing\r\n    mortality and morbidity of this aspect of the treatment is often underestimated. Outcomes are improved with early detection at lower levels of the system through screening, referral and management (at specialist centres in case of some issues like\r\n    cardiac defects).  Medical treatment for certain metabolic, endocrine and hematological conditions can improve quality of life. A clear example is congenital hypothyroidism, where early detection and treatment allows full physical and mental development to healthy adulthood,\r\n    whereas a missed diagnosis or unavailability of a simple treatment carries a risk of serious intellectual disability.  Children with some types of congenital disorders may require long term support including physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy and support from families and community. Through the resolution on birth defects of the Sixty-third World Health Assembly (2010), Member States agreed to promote primary prevention and improve the health of children with congenital disorders by: Together with partners, WHO convenes annual training programmes on the surveillance and prevention of congenital disorders. WHO is also working with partners to provide the required technical expertise for the surveillance of neural tube defects, for monitoring\r\n    fortification of staple foods with folic acid, and for improving laboratory capacity for assessing risks for folic acid-preventable congenital disorders and is assisting low- and middle-income countries in improving control and elimination of rubella and\r\n    congenital rubella syndrome through immunization.

{"title": "Condoms", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Condoms, when used correctly and consistently, are safe and highly effective in preventing transmission of most sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and unplanned pregnancies. Condoms are safe, inexpensive and widely available.  There are both external (also known as male) condoms and internal (also known as female) condoms , which are effective when used correctly.  When using a condom , lubricants (also known as lube) make it less likely that the condom will break, slip or fall off and can enhance pleasure during sex. This is especially important during anal sex as the rectum, unlike the vagina, does not have natural lubrication. Use of a water- or silicone-based lube is recommended, as other types may cause the condom to break, such as kitchen oil, butter and hand lotion. Lube may also be helpful for individuals who experience vaginal dryness associated with menopause or other skin conditions in the genital area.  Condoms are highly efficacious in preventing pregnancy, STIs and HIV. However, the effectiveness of condoms in practice depends on their correct use. The risk of pregnancy or STIs, including HIV, is greatest when condoms are not used correctly with every act of sex. Very few pregnancies or infections occur due to slips or breaks. Condoms significantly reduce the risk of most STIs when used consistently and correctly during vaginal, oral and anal sex. When used correctly with every act of sex, 98% of women whose male partners use male condoms will be protected from unplanned pregnancy; when female condoms are used, 95% of them will be protected against unplanned pregnancy.   To assure the effectiveness, condoms need to follow ISO standards and WHO/UNFPA specifications. Condoms are currently the only  available multi-purpose prevention technology against HIV, STIs and unplanned pregnancy. Condom use has been a significant tool to decrease transmission of HIV globally. A modelling study that examined the impact of past and future condom use on the AIDS epidemic in 77 high-burden countries noted that increased condom use since 1990 has averted an estimated 117 million new HIV infections, close to half (47%) of them in sub-Saharan Africa and more than one third (37%) in Asia and the Pacific  (1) .  In addition, over 300 million unplanned pregnancies are estimated to be prevented each year by using contraceptives, including condoms.  WHO’s work on condoms is covered by its overarching mandate to provide technical guidance and support Member States to strengthen programmes related to sexual and reproductive health and rights. This includes both the prevention and control of STIs, including HIV, as well as contraception and family planning services. Condoms are also included in other WHOs programs such as comprehensive sexual education and gender-based violence. WHO is also 1 of 5 cosponsors of the Human Reproduction Programme (HRP), which is the main instrument within the United Nations system for research in human reproduction to identify and address priorities for research to improve sexual and reproductive health. WHO’s work on controlling the spread of STIs, including HIV, is guided by the  Global health sector strategy on HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections, 2022–2030 .  This includes the scale-up primary prevention such as condom availability and use. In addition, WHO supports countries’ efforts to create an encouraging environment allowing individuals to discuss STIs, adopt safer sexual practices, seek treatment and provide accessibility of people-centred quality STI care.  WHO also includes condoms use as part of its contraception and family planning portfolios, ensuring that all people have access to their preferred contraceptive methods and the ability to determine if, when and how often to reproduce. This includes producing evidence-based guidelines on the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive methods and their provision, developing quality standards for their manufacture, providing pre-qualification of approved contraceptive commodities and helping countries introduce these methods.  In addition, given the  recent study  showing a decline in condom use among adolescents in Europe, WHO Regional Office for Europe calls upon policy-makers, educators and health-care providers to prioritize adolescent sexual health by offering evidence-based sexuality education in schools, enhancing access to youth-friendly sexual health services, promoting open dialogue to reduce stigma, providing specialized training for educators and health-care providers, and conducting research on factors influencing sexual behaviours, including the impact of social media and online content.   References", "Overview": "Condoms, when used correctly and consistently, are safe and highly effective in preventing transmission of most sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and unplanned pregnancies. Condoms are safe, inexpensive and widely available.  There are both external (also known as male) condoms and internal (also known as female) condoms , which are effective when used correctly.  When using a condom , lubricants (also known as lube) make it less likely that the condom will break, slip or fall off and can enhance pleasure during sex. This is especially important during anal sex as the rectum, unlike the vagina, does not have natural lubrication. Use of a water- or silicone-based lube is recommended, as other types may cause the condom to break, such as kitchen oil, butter and hand lotion. Lube may also be helpful for individuals who experience vaginal dryness associated with menopause or other skin conditions in the genital area.  Condoms are highly efficacious in preventing pregnancy, STIs and HIV. However, the effectiveness of condoms in practice depends on their correct use. The risk of pregnancy or STIs, including HIV, is greatest when condoms are not used correctly with every act of sex. Very few pregnancies or infections occur due to slips or breaks. Condoms significantly reduce the risk of most STIs when used consistently and correctly during vaginal, oral and anal sex. When used correctly with every act of sex, 98% of women whose male partners use male condoms will be protected from unplanned pregnancy; when female condoms are used, 95% of them will be protected against unplanned pregnancy.   To assure the effectiveness, condoms need to follow ISO standards and WHO/UNFPA specifications. Condoms are currently the only  available multi-purpose prevention technology against HIV, STIs and unplanned pregnancy. Condom use has been a significant tool to decrease transmission of HIV globally. A modelling study that examined the impact of past and future condom use on the AIDS epidemic in 77 high-burden countries noted that increased condom use since 1990 has averted an estimated 117 million new HIV infections, close to half (47%) of them in sub-Saharan Africa and more than one third (37%) in Asia and the Pacific  (1) .  In addition, over 300 million unplanned pregnancies are estimated to be prevented each year by using contraceptives, including condoms.  WHO’s work on condoms is covered by its overarching mandate to provide technical guidance and support Member States to strengthen programmes related to sexual and reproductive health and rights. This includes both the prevention and control of STIs, including HIV, as well as contraception and family planning services. Condoms are also included in other WHOs programs such as comprehensive sexual education and gender-based violence. WHO is also 1 of 5 cosponsors of the Human Reproduction Programme (HRP), which is the main instrument within the United Nations system for research in human reproduction to identify and address priorities for research to improve sexual and reproductive health.

{"title": "Cholera", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacterium  Vibrio cholerae . It is a global public health threat and indicates inequity and lack of social and economic development. Access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene is essential to prevent cholera and other waterborne diseases. Most people with cholera have mild or moderate diarrhoea and can be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS). However, the disease can progress rapidly, so starting treatment quickly is vital to save lives. Patients with severe disease need intravenous fluids, ORS and antibiotics. Countries need strong epidemiological and laboratory surveillance to swiftly detect and monitor outbreaks and guide responses. Cholera can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea, which can be fatal within hours if untreated. Most people infected with  V. cholerae  do not develop symptoms but can spread the bacteria through their faeces for 1–10 days. Symptoms appear 12 hours to 5 days after infection  (2) . Most people with the disease have mild or moderate symptoms. A minority of patients develop severe acute watery diarrhoea and life-threatening dehydration. Cholera has been known for many centuries. The first pandemic, or global epidemic, was recorded in the 19th century. Since then, six pandemics have killed millions of people worldwide. The current (seventh) pandemic started in south Asia in 1961 and continues to affect populations globally. Only two serogroups, O1 and O139, cause cholera outbreaks.  V. cholerae  O1 has caused all recent outbreaks.  V. cholerae  O139 caused outbreaks in Asia in the past but has recently only been identified in sporadic cases. There is no difference in the illness caused by the two serogroups. Cholera outbreaks occur regularly in some countries. In others, they are less frequent, and it may be years between outbreaks. Cholera is linked to limited access to safe water, basic sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices. This may be due to conflict, population displacement, climate events like cyclones, floods or drought, and lack of investment in maintaining and improving WASH services and infrastructure. The number of cholera cases reported to WHO has continued to rise in recent years. In 2023, 535 321 cases and 4007 deaths were reported to WHO from 45 countries  (3) . The discrepancy between these figures and the numbers estimated by researchers is likely due to limited surveillance systems and cases not being recorded out of fear of repercussions for trade and tourism. Preventing and controlling cholera involves a combination of strengthening surveillance, improving water, sanitation and hygiene, increasing risk communication and community engagement, improving access to quality treatment and implementing oral cholera vaccine campaigns. Cholera surveillance should be part of an integrated disease surveillance system. This includes timely reporting, data analysis, interpretation and sharing of information from local to global levels. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are useful for early detection of probable cholera outbreaks, but confirmation requires laboratory testing by culture, seroagglutination or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Countries at risk or affected by cholera should strengthen their surveillance systems according to the revised Global Taskforce on Cholera Control (GTFCC) recommendations to quickly detect and respond to outbreaks.  The long-term solution for cholera control lies in economic development and universal access to safe drinking water, basic sanitation and good hygiene practices. WASH interventions help prevent many waterborne illnesses, including cholera, and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals. During outbreaks, implementing WASH activities can reduce cholera transmission. These activities include improving WASH in healthcare facilities, conducting water quality monitoring, distributing WASH kits to communities and promoting protective hygiene practices. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully with prompt ORS administration. Severely dehydrated patients are at risk of dying from dehydration and need rapid intravenous fluids. They also receive oral rehydration solution and antibiotics. Patients with underlying conditions or comorbidities may require additional care in specific treatment centres. The case fatality rate in treatment centres should remain below 1%. Community access to ORS is essential during a cholera outbreak. Mass administration of antibiotics to prevent cholera (chemoprophylaxis) is not recommended, as it has no proven effect on the spread of cholera and may contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Community engagement involves collaborating with people and communities to develop and implement programmes designed to address their needs. Local culture, practices and beliefs are central to promoting protective practices, such as handwashing with soap and water, safe preparation and storage of food and water, and safe disposal of faeces. Funeral practices for individuals who die from cholera may need to be adapted to prevent infection among attendees. Communities should be involved in deciding the location of oral rehydration points (ORPs) and other community cholera control interventions. Community engagement is essential for effectively communicating the potential risks and symptoms of cholera, precautions to take to avoid cholera, when and where to report cases, and the importance of seeking immediate treatment if symptoms appear. Currently, three WHO pre-qualified oral cholera vaccines (OCV) are available: Dukoral®, Euvichol-Plus®, and Euvichol-S®. All require two doses to fully protect an adult. One dose of Euvichol-Plus® or Euvichol-S® provides good short-term protection. Euvichol-S®, pre-qualified by WHO in 2024, is a simplified version of Euvichol-Plus®. The Shancol vaccine is no longer produced. Euvichol-Plus® and Euvichol-S® do not require a buffer solution and can be given to anyone over one year old. These are the only vaccines currently available for mass vaccination campaigns through the Global OCV Stockpile, supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Since October 2022, due to an ongoing global shortage of vaccines, and with the acceptance of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts SAGE), only one-dose vaccine regimens are being used. OCV is safe during pregnancy.

Cholera surveillance should be part of an integrated disease surveillance system. This includes timely reporting, data analysis, interpretation and sharing of information from local to global levels. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are useful for early detection of probable cholera outbreaks, but confirmation requires laboratory testing by culture, seroagglutination or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Countries at risk or affected by cholera should strengthen their surveillance systems according to the revised Global Taskforce on Cholera Control (GTFCC) recommendations to quickly detect and respond to outbreaks.  The long-term solution for cholera control lies in economic development and universal access to safe drinking water, basic sanitation and good hygiene practices. WASH interventions help prevent many waterborne illnesses, including cholera, and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals. During outbreaks, implementing WASH activities can reduce cholera transmission. These activities include improving WASH in healthcare facilities, conducting water quality monitoring, distributing WASH kits to communities and promoting protective hygiene practices. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully with prompt ORS administration. Severely dehydrated patients are at risk of dying from dehydration and need rapid intravenous fluids. They also receive oral rehydration solution and antibiotics. Patients with underlying conditions or comorbidities may require additional care in specific treatment centres. The case fatality rate in treatment centres should remain below 1%. Community access to ORS is essential during a cholera outbreak. Mass administration of antibiotics to prevent cholera (chemoprophylaxis) is not recommended, as it has no proven effect on the spread of cholera and may contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Community engagement involves collaborating with people and communities to develop and implement programmes designed to address their needs. Local culture, practices and beliefs are central to promoting protective practices, such as handwashing with soap and water, safe preparation and storage of food and water, and safe disposal of faeces. Funeral practices for individuals who die from cholera may need to be adapted to prevent infection among attendees. Communities should be involved in deciding the location of oral rehydration points (ORPs) and other community cholera control interventions. Community engagement is essential for effectively communicating the potential risks and symptoms of cholera, precautions to take to avoid cholera, when and where to report cases, and the importance of seeking immediate treatment if symptoms appear. Currently, three WHO pre-qualified oral cholera vaccines (OCV) are available: Dukoral®, Euvichol-Plus®, and Euvichol-S®. All require two doses to fully protect an adult. One dose of Euvichol-Plus® or Euvichol-S® provides good short-term protection. Euvichol-S®, pre-qualified by WHO in 2024, is a simplified version of Euvichol-Plus®. The Shancol vaccine is no longer produced. Euvichol-Plus® and Euvichol-S® do not require a buffer solution and can be given to anyone over one year old. These are the only vaccines currently available for mass vaccination campaigns through the Global OCV Stockpile, supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Since October 2022, due to an ongoing global shortage of vaccines, and with the acceptance of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts SAGE), only one-dose vaccine regimens are being used. OCV is safe during pregnancy.

There is no difference in the illness caused by the two serogroups. Cholera outbreaks occur regularly in some countries. In others, they are less frequent, and it may be years between outbreaks. Cholera is linked to limited access to safe water, basic sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices. This may be due to conflict, population displacement, climate events like cyclones, floods or drought, and lack of investment in maintaining and improving WASH services and infrastructure. The number of cholera cases reported to WHO has continued to rise in recent years. In 2023, 535 321 cases and 4007 deaths were reported to WHO from 45 countries  (3) .

All require two doses to fully protect an adult. One dose of Euvichol-Plus® or Euvichol-S® provides good short-term protection. Euvichol-S®, pre-qualified by WHO in 2024, is a simplified version of Euvichol-Plus®. The Shancol vaccine is no longer produced. Euvichol-Plus® and Euvichol-S® do not require a buffer solution and can be given to anyone over one year old. These are the only vaccines currently available for mass vaccination campaigns through the Global OCV Stockpile, supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Since October 2022, due to an ongoing global shortage of vaccines, and with the acceptance of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts SAGE), only one-dose vaccine regimens are being used.

{"title": "Chlamydia", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection that can occur in both men and women. It is caused by a bacterium called  Chlamydia trachomatis . It is easily treated and cured with antibiotics. Chlamydia is unlikely to lead to any long-term problems if treated early. However, without treatment, chlamydia can cause serious problems and may facilitate the transmission and acquisition of HIV and other STIs. If not treated, chlamydia can cause serious problems, including pelvic inflammatory disease and an increased risk of infertility and ectopic pregnancy. In pregnant women, it can cause the baby to be born early (prematurity) or with low birth weight.  Correct and consistent use of condoms during sex is the most effective way to prevent chlamydia. In 2020, an estimated 128.5 million new infections with  Chlamydia trachomatis  occurred worldwide among adults aged 15 to 49 years. The global prevalence among people aged 15–49 years was estimated to be 4.0% for women and 2.5% for men in 2020. Chlamydial infection is more common in young people. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by particular strains of  Chlamydia trachomatis,  is relatively rare, but there has been a resurgence in some countries, especially among gay men and other men who have sex with men. Another strain of the Chlamydia cause  trachoma  but transmitted by contact with discharge from the eye and nose, particularly among young children. Many people with chlamydia have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may not appear until up to three weeks after having sex with someone who has chlamydia. Common symptoms in men include:  In women, common symptoms include:  Anal infection in women and men can cause anorectal: Oral infection is most often without symptoms.  Infants born to mothers with chlamydia may experience eye infections or pneumonia. These can be treated with antibiotic medications for newborns. The LGV type of chlamydia can cause severe inflammation and can lead to genital ulcer, lymph node enlargement, or inflammation of the anorectal area with discharge, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, constipation, fever or pain while passing stools. Chlamydia can cause serious problems if left untreated, particularly among\r\nwomen. Women may develop pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), can experience\r\nabdominal and pelvic pain, and in later stages develop infertility and ectopic\r\npregnancy (a pregnancy that occurs outside the womb).  Men may develop a painful infection in their testicles (epididymitis,\r\nepididymo-orchitis). In rare cases, this can lead to infertility.  Additionally, chlamydia may cause arthritis symptoms, such as swollen joints\r\n(arthritis) and inflammation of the eyes.  Infection with chlamydia can cause stigma and affect personal relationships.\r\nThese effects are important but often not quantifiable. Neonatal infection can cause conjunctivitis (eye infection) and pneumonia.\r\nIt can also cause preterm deliveries and low birth weight.  LGV can be an invasive, systemic infection and, if it is not treated early,\r\ncan lead to chronic oozing lesions around anorectal region, strictures or\r\nreactive joint pain and swelling.  Healthcare providers will discuss the patient’s medical and sexual history and conduct a genital examination, including speculum examination and palpation, to enable them have important clues to clinical diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic test is nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), considered as the gold standard for diagnosing  C. trachomatis. These  can be performed in the lab or at the point of care using molecular tests.   Urine samples are commonly used for diagnosing chlamydia but are less sensitive than swab-collected samples from genital (vaginal or urethral), anal and oropharyngeal sites. The collection of samples from different anatomic sites depends on sexual practices and medical history.  Self-collection of samples  is recommended as the tests results are similar than those collected by a health provider. Because the majority of cases are without symptoms, regular testing for  individuals at increased risk of chlamydial infection , such as female sex workers, is recommended to prevent the development of complications and the spread of infection.  In many primary health care settings where diagnostic capacity for detecting  C. trachomatis  is not available, a  syndromic approach for case management  is recommended. In the presence chlamydia (or vaginal/urethral/anal discharge), tests for other sexually transmitted infections (such as HIV, syphilis and gonorrhoea) are recommended together with notification of sexual partner(s).  For LGV diagnosis a specific molecular test needs to be performed. Chlamydia is treatable and curable.  Uncomplicated chlamydia is treated with antibiotic tablets including doxycycline or azithromycin. Repeated infections can occur if sexual partners are not treated, and if individuals have sex without condoms with someone who has the infection.  Newborns with chlamydial eye infection (conjunctivitis) are treated with azithromycin. People should wait 7 days after taking the medicine before having sex or, if not possible, use condoms correctly. They should notify their sexual partner(s) to get tested and treated, if necessary.   WHO guidelines for the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis Consistent and correct use of condoms when having vaginal and anal sex is the only way to prevent chlamydial infection.   If you are pregnant, getting tested for chlamydia and receiving prompt treatment if you test positive can prevent transmission to the baby. There are no vaccines for the prevention of chlamydial infection. The WHO has recognized chlamydia as an important public health problem along with other sexually transmitted infections and has set ambitious targets to reduce their global burden through prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies.

The likelihood of surviving a diagnosis of childhood cancer depends on the country in which the child lives; in high-income countries, more than 80% of children with cancer are cured, but in many LMICs less than 30% are cured  (2) . Although childhood cancer cannot generally be prevented or identified through screening, most types of childhood cancer can be cured with generic medicines and other forms of treatment, including surgery and radiotherapy. The reasons for lower survival rates in LMICs include delay in diagnosis, an inability to obtain an accurate diagnosis, inaccessible therapy, abandonment of treatment, death from toxicity (side effects) and avoidable relapse. Improving access to childhood cancer care, including to essential medicines and technologies, is highly cost-effective, feasible and can improve survival in  all income settings . Childhood cancer data systems are needed to drive continuous improvements in the quality of care, and to inform policy decisions. Cancer occurs in people of all ages and can affect any part of the body. It begins with genetic change in single cells, that can then grow into a mass (or tumour), invade other parts of the body and cause harm and death if left untreated. Unlike cancer in adults, most childhood cancers do not have a known cause. Many studies have sought to identify the causes of childhood cancer, but very few cancers in children are caused by environmental or lifestyle factors. Cancer prevention efforts in children should focus on behaviours that will prevent the child from developing preventable cancer as an adult. Some chronic infections, such as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus and malaria, are risk factors for childhood cancer. They are particularly relevant in LMICs. Other infections can increase a child’s risk of developing cancer as an adult, so it is important to be vaccinated (against hepatitis B to help prevent liver cancer and against human papillomavirus to help prevent cervical cancer) and to other pursue other methods such as early detection and treatment of chronic infections that can lead to cancer. Current data suggest that approximately 10% of all children with cancer have a predisposition because of genetic factors  (3) . Further research is needed to identify factors impacting cancer development in children. Because it is generally not possible to prevent cancer in children, the most effective strategy to reduce the burden of cancer in children and improve outcomes is to focus on a prompt, correct diagnosis followed by effective, evidence-based therapy with tailored supportive care. When identified early, cancer is more likely to respond to effective treatment and result in a greater probability of survival, less suffering, and often less expensive and less intensive treatment. Significant improvements can be made in the lives of children with cancer by detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care. A correct diagnosis is essential to treat children with cancer because each cancer requires a specific treatment regimen that may include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.  Early diagnosis  consists of 3 components: Early diagnosis is relevant in all settings and improves survival for many cancers. Programmes to promote early and correct diagnosis have been successfully implemented in countries of all income levels, often through the collaborative efforts of governments, civil society and nongovernmental organizations, with vital roles played by parent groups. Childhood cancer is associated with a range of warning symptoms, such as fever, severe and persistent headaches, bone pain and weight loss, that can be detected by families and by trained primary health-care providers. Screening is generally not helpful for childhood cancers. In some select cases, it can be considered in high-risk populations. For example, some eye cancers in children can be caused by a mutation that is inherited, so if that mutation or disease is identified in the family of a child with retinoblastoma, genetic counselling can be offered and siblings monitored with regular eye examinations early in life. Genetic causes of childhood cancers are relevant in only a small proportion children with cancer. There is no high-quality evidence to support population-based screening programmes in children. A correct diagnosis is essential to prescribe appropriate therapy for the type and extent of the disease. Standard therapies include chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiotherapy. Children also need special attention to their continued physical and cognitive growth and nutritional status, which requires a dedicated, multi-disciplinary team. Access to effective diagnosis, essential medicines, pathology, blood products, radiation therapy, technology and psychosocial and supportive care are variable and inequitable around the world.  However, cure is possible for more than 80% of children with cancer when childhood cancer services are accessible. Pharmacological treatment, for example, includes inexpensive generic medications included on the  WHO List of essential medicines for children . Children who complete treatment require ongoing care to monitor for cancer recurrence and to manage any possible long-term impact of treatment. Palliative care relieves symptoms caused by cancer and improves the quality of life of patients and their families. Not all children with cancer can be cured, but relief of suffering is possible for everyone. Paediatric palliative care is considered a core component of comprehensive care, starting when the disease is diagnosed and continuing throughout treatment and care, regardless of whether a child receives treatment with curative intent. Palliative care programmes can be delivered through community and home-based care, providing pain relief and psychosocial support to patients and their families. Adequate access to oral morphine and other pain medicines should be provided for the treatment of moderate to severe cancer pain, which affects more than 80% of cancer patients in the terminal phase.

{"title": "Chikungunya", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an RNA virus in the  alphavirus  genus of the family  Togaviridae . The name chikungunya derives from a word in the Kimakonde language of southern Tanzania, meaning “that which bends up” and describes the contorted posture of infected people with severe joint pain. CHIKV was first identified in the United Republic of Tanzania in 1952 and subsequently in other countries Africa and Asia  (1) . Urban outbreaks were first recorded in Thailand in 1967 and in India in the 1970s  (2) . Since 2004, outbreaks of CHIKV have become more frequent and widespread, caused partly due to viral adaptations allowing the virus to be spread more easily by  Aedes albopictus  mosquitoes and because CHIKV has been introduced into immunologically naïve populations. CHIKV has now been identified in >110 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Transmission has been interrupted for several years on islands where a high proportion of the population is infected and then immune; however, transmission often persists in countries where large parts of the population have not yet been infected. All regions with established populations of  Aedes aegypti  or  Aedes albopictus  mosquitoes have now experienced local mosquito-borne transmission. Chikungunya virus is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, most commonly  Aedes  aegypti  and  Aedes  albopictus , which can also transmit dengue and Zika viruses. These mosquitoes bite primarily during daylight hours and  Aedes aegypti  feeds both indoors and outdoors. They lay eggs in containers with standing water. Both species feed outdoors, and  Ae. aegypti  also feeds indoors. When an uninfected mosquito feeds on a person who has CHIKV circulating in their blood, the mosquito can ingest the virus. The virus then replicates in the mosquito over several days, enters its salivary glands, and can be transmitted into a new human host when the mosquito bites them. The virus again begins to replicate in this newly infected person and reaches high concentrations in their blood, at which point they can further infect other mosquitoes and perpetuate the transmission cycle. In symptomatic patients, CHIKV disease onset is typically 4–8 days (range 2–12 days) after the bite of an infected mosquito. It is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, frequently accompanied by severe joint pain. The joint pain is often debilitating and usually lasts for a few days but may be prolonged, lasting for weeks, months or even years. Other common signs and symptoms include joint swelling, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Since these symptoms overlap with other infections, including those with dengue and Zika viruses, cases can be misdiagnosed. In the absence of significant joint pain, symptoms in infected individuals are usually mild and the infection may go unrecognized. Most patients recover fully from the infection; however, occasional cases of eye, heart, and neurological complications have been reported with CHIKV infections. Patients at extremes of the age spectrum are at higher risk for severe disease including newborns infected during delivery to infected mothers or bitten by infected mosquitoes in the weeks after birth, and older people with underlying medical conditions. Patients with severe disease require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage and death. Once an individual is recovered, available evidence suggests they are likely to be immune from future chikungunya infections  (4) . Chikungunya virus may be detected directly in blood samples collected during the first week of illness using tests such as reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR). Other tests can detect a person’s immune response to chikungunya virus infection. These are typically used after the first week of infection to test for antibodies to the virus. The antibody levels are typically detectable by the first week after illness onset and can still be detected for about 2 months.   The clinical management includes addressing fever and joint pain with anti-pyretics and optimal analgesics, drinking plenty of fluids and general rest. There is no specific antiviral drug treatment for CHIKV infections. Paracetamol or acetaminophen are recommended for pain relief and reducing fever until dengue infections are ruled out, as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can increase the risk of bleeding. There are currently two chikungunya vaccines that have received regulatory approvals and/or have been recommended for use in populations at risk in several countries, but the vaccines are not yet widely available nor in widespread use. WHO and external expert advisors are reviewing vaccine trial and post-marketing data in the context of global chikungunya epidemiology to inform possible recommendations for use.   Avoidance of mosquito bites offers the best protection against CHIKV infection. Patients suspected of having CHIKV infection should avoid getting mosquito bites during the first week of illness to prevent further transmission to mosquitoes, that may in turn infect other people.  The main method to reduce transmission of CHIKV is through control of the mosquito vectors and reduction of mosquito breeding sites. This requires mobilization of communities, who are critical in reducing mosquito breeding sites through emptying and cleaning containers that contain water on a weekly basis, disposing of waste, and supporting local mosquito control programmes. During outbreaks, insecticides may be sprayed to kill flying adult mosquitoes, applied to surfaces in and around containers where the mosquitoes land, and used to treat water in containers to kill the immature mosquito larvae. This may also be performed by health authorities as an emergency measure to control the mosquito population. People living in or visiting areas with CHIKV transmission are advised to wear clothing that minimizes skin exposure to the day-biting mosquitoes. Window and door screens should be used to prevent mosquitoes from entering homes. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET, IR3535 or icaridin.  Insecticide-treated mosquito nets should be used against day-biting mosquitoes by persons who sleep during the daytime, for example young children, sick patients or older people.

The name chikungunya derives from a word in the Kimakonde language of southern Tanzania, meaning “that which bends up” and describes the contorted posture of infected people with severe joint pain. CHIKV was first identified in the United Republic of Tanzania in 1952 and subsequently in other countries Africa and Asia  (1) . Urban outbreaks were first recorded in Thailand in 1967 and in India in the 1970s  (2) . Since 2004, outbreaks of CHIKV have become more frequent and widespread, caused partly due to viral adaptations allowing the virus to be spread more easily by  Aedes albopictus  mosquitoes and because CHIKV has been introduced into immunologically naïve populations. CHIKV has now been identified in >110 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Transmission has been interrupted for several years on islands where a high proportion of the population is infected and then immune; however, transmission often persists in countries where large parts of the population have not yet been infected. All regions with established populations of  Aedes aegypti  or  Aedes albopictus  mosquitoes have now experienced local mosquito-borne transmission. Chikungunya virus is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, most commonly  Aedes  aegypti  and  Aedes  albopictus , which can also transmit dengue and Zika viruses. These mosquitoes bite primarily during daylight hours and  Aedes aegypti  feeds both indoors and outdoors. They lay eggs in containers with standing water. Both species feed outdoors, and  Ae. aegypti  also feeds indoors. When an uninfected mosquito feeds on a person who has CHIKV circulating in their blood, the mosquito can ingest the virus. The virus then replicates in the mosquito over several days, enters its salivary glands, and can be transmitted into a new human host when the mosquito bites them. The virus again begins to replicate in this newly infected person and reaches high concentrations in their blood, at which point they can further infect other mosquitoes and perpetuate the transmission cycle. In symptomatic patients, CHIKV disease onset is typically 4–8 days (range 2–12 days) after the bite of an infected mosquito. It is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, frequently accompanied by severe joint pain. The joint pain is often debilitating and usually lasts for a few days but may be prolonged, lasting for weeks, months or even years. Other common signs and symptoms include joint swelling, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Since these symptoms overlap with other infections, including those with dengue and Zika viruses, cases can be misdiagnosed. In the absence of significant joint pain, symptoms in infected individuals are usually mild and the infection may go unrecognized. Most patients recover fully from the infection; however, occasional cases of eye, heart, and neurological complications have been reported with CHIKV infections. Patients at extremes of the age spectrum are at higher risk for severe disease including newborns infected during delivery to infected mothers or bitten by infected mosquitoes in the weeks after birth, and older people with underlying medical conditions. Patients with severe disease require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage and death. Once an individual is recovered, available evidence suggests they are likely to be immune from future chikungunya infections  (4) . Chikungunya virus may be detected directly in blood samples collected during the first week of illness using tests such as reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR). Other tests can detect a person’s immune response to chikungunya virus infection. These are typically used after the first week of infection to test for antibodies to the virus. The antibody levels are typically detectable by the first week after illness onset and can still be detected for about 2 months.   The clinical management includes addressing fever and joint pain with anti-pyretics and optimal analgesics, drinking plenty of fluids and general rest. There is no specific antiviral drug treatment for CHIKV infections. Paracetamol or acetaminophen are recommended for pain relief and reducing fever until dengue infections are ruled out, as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can increase the risk of bleeding.

In the same year, about 94% of the 350 000 deaths caused by cervical cancer occurred in low- and middle-income countries. The highest rates of incidence and mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and South-East Asia. These regional differences reflect inequalities in access to vaccination, screening and treatment services. They are further influenced by risk factors such as HIV prevalence and by broader social and economic determinants, including gender inequality and poverty. Women living with HIV are six times more likely to develop cervical cancer compared to the general population, and an estimated 5% of all cervical cancer cases are attributable to HIV  (1) . Cervical cancer disproportionately affects younger women, and as a result, 20% of children who lose their mother to cancer do so due to cervical cancer  (2) . Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by infection with oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection which can affect the skin, genital area, anal area and throat. Almost all sexually active people will be infected at some point, usually without symptoms. In most cases, the immune system clears the virus naturally. Persistent infection with certain carcinogenic types of HPV can cause abnormal cells that may develop into cancer. Persistent HPV infection of the cervix (the lower part of the uterus or womb, which opens into the vagina – also called the birth canal) can lead to precancerous lesions which if left untreated cause about 95% of cervical cancers. It usually takes 15–20 years for abnormal cells to become cancer. In women with weakened immune systems, such as untreated HIV, this process can be faster and take 5–10 years. Factors that increase the risk of cancer progression include: the grade of oncogenicity of the HPV type, immune status, the presence of other sexually transmitted infections, number of births, young age at first pregnancy, hormonal contraceptive use, and smoking. Boosting public awareness, strengthening health literacy, and improving access to information and services are key to prevention and control across the life course: As of 2025, there are 8 licensed HPV vaccines, five of which have received WHO pre-qualification and are available globally. All these protect against the high-risk HPV types 16 and 18, which cause ~76% of cervical cancers. HPV vaccination is a priority for all girls aged 9–14 years, before they become sexually active. Depending on the national schedule the vaccine may be given as one or two doses. Individuals with compromised immune systems, including people living with HIV, should ideally receive two or three doses. Some countries have additionally chosen to vaccinate boys to further reduce the prevalence of HPV in the community and to prevent cancers in men caused by HPV. Other important ways to prevent HPV infection and reduce the risk of cervical cancer include: Women should be screened for cervical cancer with a high-performance test every 5–10 years starting at age 30.  Women living with HIV should be screened every 3-5 years, starting at age 25 . The global strategy encourages a minimum of two lifetime screens with a high-performance test by age 35 and again by age 45. Precancers rarely cause symptoms, which is why regular cervical cancer screening is important, even if you have been vaccinated against HPV. Self-collection of a sample for HPV testing, which may be a preferred choice for women, has been shown to be as reliable as samples collected by healthcare providers. After a positive screen, a health-care provider can look for changes on the cervix (such as precancers) which may develop into cervical cancer if left untreated. Treatment of precancers is a simple and effective procedure to prevent cervical cancer. Treatment may be offered in the same visit for screening (the screen-and-treat approach) or after a second test (the screen, triage and treat approach), which is especially recommended for women living with HIV. Treatment of precancerous lesions is usually quick and may involve limited discomfort compared to other medical procedures. The process involves examining the cervix after applying acetic acid, with or without magnification (colposcopy or naked-eye visual inspection), to locate the lesion and determine the appropriate treatment. Treatment options include: Cervical cancer can be cured if diagnosed and treated at an early stage of disease. Recognizing symptoms and seeking medical advice to address any concerns is a critical step. Women should consult a health-care professional if they notice: Clinical evaluations and diagnostic tests are essential for confirming cervical cancer. These are generally followed by referral for treatment services, which can include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as palliative care to provide supportive care and pain management. Management pathways for invasive cancer care are important tools to ensure that a patient is referred promptly and supported as they navigate the steps to diagnosis and treatment decisions. Features of quality care include: As low- and middle-income countries scale-up cervical screening, more cases of invasive cervical cancer will be detected, especially in previously unscreened populations. Therefore, referral and cancer management strategies need to be implemented and expanded alongside prevention services. All countries have made a commitment to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. The WHO  Global strategy  defines elimination as reducing the number of new cases annually to 4 or fewer cases per 100 000 women and sets three targets to be achieved by the year 2030 to put all countries on the pathway to elimination in the coming decades: Modelling estimates  that achieving the elimination goal could avert 74 million new cases of cervical cancer and prevent 62 million deaths by 2120,  with additional analyses highlighting the impact among women living with HIV .

{"title": "Cancer", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body. Other terms used are malignant tumours and neoplasms. One defining\r\n    feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs; the latter process is referred to as metastasis. Widespread metastases\r\n    are the primary cause of death from cancer. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 (1). The most common in 2020 (in terms of new cases of cancer) were: The most common causes of cancer death in 2020 were: Each year, approximately 400 000 children develop cancer. The most common cancers vary between countries. Cervical cancer is the most common in 23 countries.  Cancer arises from the transformation of normal cells into tumour cells in a multi-stage process that generally progresses from a pre-cancerous lesion to a malignant tumour. These changes are the result of the interaction between a person's genetic factors\r\n    and three categories of external agents, including: WHO, through its cancer research agency, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), maintains a classification of cancer-causing agents. The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age, most likely due to a build-up of risks for specific cancers that increase with age. The overall risk accumulation is combined with the tendency for cellular repair mechanisms to be less effective as\r\n    a person grows older. Tobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and air pollution are risk factors for cancer and other noncommunicable diseases.   Some chronic infections are risk factors for cancer; this is a particular issue in low- and middle-income countries. Approximately 13% of cancers diagnosed in 2018 globally were attributed to carcinogenic infections, including Helicobacter pylori, human\r\n    papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (2). Hepatitis B and C viruses and some types of HPV increase the risk for liver and cervical cancer, respectively. Infection with HIV increases the risk of developing cervical cancer six-fold and substantially increases the risk of developing select other\r\n    cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma. Between 30 and 50% of cancers can currently be prevented by avoiding risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. The cancer burden can also be reduced through early detection of cancer and appropriate treatment and care\r\n    of patients who develop cancer. Many cancers have a high chance of cure if diagnosed early and treated appropriately.  Cancer risk can be reduced by:  Cancer mortality is reduced when cases are detected and treated early. There are two components of early detection: early diagnosis and screening. When identified early, cancer is more likely to respond to treatment and can result in a greater probability of survival with less morbidity, as well as less expensive treatment. Significant improvements can be made in the lives of cancer patients by\r\n    detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care. Early diagnosis consists of three components: Early diagnosis of symptomatic cancers is relevant in all settings and the majority of cancers. Cancer programmes should be designed to reduce delays in, and barriers to, diagnosis, treatment and supportive care.  Screening aims to identify individuals with findings suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer before they have developed symptoms. When abnormalities are identified during screening, further tests to establish a definitive diagnosis should follow,\r\n    as should referral for treatment if cancer is proven to be present. Screening programmes are effective for some but not all cancer types and in general are far more complex and resource-intensive than early diagnosis as they require special equipment and dedicated personnel. Even when screening programmes are established,\r\n    early diagnosis programmes are still necessary to identify those cancer cases occurring in people who do not meet the age or risk factor criteria for screening. Patient selection for screening programmes is based on age and risk factors to avoid excessive false positive studies. Examples of screening methods are: Quality assurance is required for both screening and early diagnosis programmes. A correct cancer diagnosis is essential for appropriate and effective treatment because every cancer type requires a specific treatment regimen. Treatment usually includes surgery, radiotherapy, and/or systemic therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal treatments,\r\n    targeted biological therapies). Proper selection of a treatment regimen takes into consideration both the cancer and the individual being treated. Completion of the treatment protocol in a defined period of time is important to achieve the predicted\r\n    therapeutic result.  Determining the goals of treatment is an important first step. The primary goal is generally to cure cancer or to considerably prolong life. Improving the patient's quality of life is also an important goal. This can be achieved by support for the patient’s\r\n    physical, psychosocial and spiritual well-being and palliative care in terminal stages of cancer.   Some of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and colorectal cancer, have high cure probabilities when detected early and treated according to best practices. Some cancer types, such as testicular seminoma and different types of leukaemia and lymphoma in children, also have high cure rates if appropriate treatment is provided, even when cancerous cells are present in other areas of the body. There is, however, a significant variation in treatment availability between countries of different income levels; comprehensive treatment is reportedly available in more than 90% of high-income countries but less than 15% of low-income countries (3). Palliative care is treatment to relieve, rather than cure, symptoms and suffering caused by cancer and to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. Palliative care can help people live more comfortably. It is particularly needed\r\n        in places with a high proportion of patients in advanced stages of cancer where there is little chance of cure. Relief from physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems through palliative care is possible for more than 90% of patients with advanced stages of cancer.  Effective public health strategies, comprising community- and home-based care, are essential to provide pain relief and palliative care for patients and their families. In 2017, the World Health Assembly passed the  Resolution Cancer prevention and control in the context of an integrated approach (WHA70.12)  that urges\r\n        governments and WHO to accelerate action to achieve the targets specified in the  Global Action Plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013-2020  and the 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development to reduce premature mortality from cancer.

Even when screening programmes are established,\r\n    early diagnosis programmes are still necessary to identify those cancer cases occurring in people who do not meet the age or risk factor criteria for screening. Patient selection for screening programmes is based on age and risk factors to avoid excessive false positive studies. Examples of screening methods are: Quality assurance is required for both screening and early diagnosis programmes. A correct cancer diagnosis is essential for appropriate and effective treatment because every cancer type requires a specific treatment regimen. Treatment usually includes surgery, radiotherapy, and/or systemic therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal treatments,\r\n    targeted biological therapies). Proper selection of a treatment regimen takes into consideration both the cancer and the individual being treated. Completion of the treatment protocol in a defined period of time is important to achieve the predicted\r\n    therapeutic result.  Determining the goals of treatment is an important first step. The primary goal is generally to cure cancer or to considerably prolong life. Improving the patient's quality of life is also an important goal. This can be achieved by support for the patient’s\r\n    physical, psychosocial and spiritual well-being and palliative care in terminal stages of cancer.   Some of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and colorectal cancer, have high cure probabilities when detected early and treated according to best practices. Some cancer types, such as testicular seminoma and different types of leukaemia and lymphoma in children, also have high cure rates if appropriate treatment is provided, even when cancerous cells are present in other areas of the body. There is, however, a significant variation in treatment availability between countries of different income levels; comprehensive treatment is reportedly available in more than 90% of high-income countries but less than 15% of low-income countries (3). Palliative care is treatment to relieve, rather than cure, symptoms and suffering caused by cancer and to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. Palliative care can help people live more comfortably. It is particularly needed\r\n        in places with a high proportion of patients in advanced stages of cancer where there is little chance of cure. Relief from physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems through palliative care is possible for more than 90% of patients with advanced stages of cancer.  Effective public health strategies, comprising community- and home-based care, are essential to provide pain relief and palliative care for patients and their families. In 2017, the World Health Assembly passed the  Resolution Cancer prevention and control in the context of an integrated approach (WHA70.12)  that urges\r\n        governments and WHO to accelerate action to achieve the targets specified in the  Global Action Plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013-2020  and the 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development to reduce premature mortality from cancer.

Geneva: World Health Organization; 2020.", "Causes": "Cancer arises from the transformation of normal cells into tumour cells in a multi-stage process that generally progresses from a pre-cancerous lesion to a malignant tumour. These changes are the result of the interaction between a person's genetic factors\r\n    and three categories of external agents, including: WHO, through its cancer research agency, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), maintains a classification of cancer-causing agents. The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age, most likely due to a build-up of risks for specific cancers that increase with age. The overall risk accumulation is combined with the tendency for cellular repair mechanisms to be less effective as\r\n    a person grows older. Tobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and air pollution are risk factors for cancer and other noncommunicable diseases.   Some chronic infections are risk factors for cancer; this is a particular issue in low- and middle-income countries. Approximately 13% of cancers diagnosed in 2018 globally were attributed to carcinogenic infections, including Helicobacter pylori, human\r\n    papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (2). Hepatitis B and C viruses and some types of HPV increase the risk for liver and cervical cancer, respectively. Infection with HIV increases the risk of developing cervical cancer six-fold and substantially increases the risk of developing select other\r\n    cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma. Between 30 and 50% of cancers can currently be prevented by avoiding risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. The cancer burden can also be reduced through early detection of cancer and appropriate treatment and care\r\n    of patients who develop cancer. Many cancers have a high chance of cure if diagnosed early and treated appropriately.  Cancer risk can be reduced by:  Cancer mortality is reduced when cases are detected and treated early. There are two components of early detection: early diagnosis and screening. When identified early, cancer is more likely to respond to treatment and can result in a greater probability of survival with less morbidity, as well as less expensive treatment. Significant improvements can be made in the lives of cancer patients by\r\n    detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care. Early diagnosis consists of three components: Early diagnosis of symptomatic cancers is relevant in all settings and the majority of cancers. Cancer programmes should be designed to reduce delays in, and barriers to, diagnosis, treatment and supportive care.  Screening aims to identify individuals with findings suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer before they have developed symptoms. When abnormalities are identified during screening, further tests to establish a definitive diagnosis should follow,\r\n    as should referral for treatment if cancer is proven to be present.

{"title": "Breast cancer", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked, the tumours can spread throughout the body and become fatal. Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts and/or the milk-producing lobules of the breast. The earliest form (in situ) is not life-threatening and can be detected in early stages. Cancer cells can spread into nearby breast tissue (invasion). This creates tumours that cause lumps or thickening.  Invasive cancers can spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs (metastasize). Metastasis can be life-threatening and fatal. Treatment is based on the person, the type of cancer and its spread. Treatment combines surgery, radiation therapy and medications. In 2022, there were an estimated 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 670 000 deaths globally. Breast cancer occurs in every country of the world in women at any age after puberty but with increasing rates in later life.   Global estimates reveal striking inequities in the breast cancer burden according to human development. For instance, in countries with a very high Human Development Index (HDI), 1 in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and 1 in 71 women die of it.  In contrast, in countries with a low HDI; while only 1 in 27 women is diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, 1 in 48 women will die from it. Female gender is the strongest breast cancer risk factor. Approximately 99% of breast cancers occur in women and 0.5–1% of breast cancers occur in men. The treatment of breast cancer in men follows the same principles of management as for women. Certain factors increase the risk of breast cancer including increasing age, obesity, harmful use of alcohol, family history of breast cancer, history of radiation exposure, reproductive history (such as age that menstrual periods began and age at first pregnancy), tobacco use and postmenopausal hormone therapy. Approximately half of breast cancers develop in women who have no identifiable breast cancer risk factor other than gender (female) and age (over 40 years).  Family history of breast cancer increases the risk of breast cancer, but most women diagnosed with breast cancer do not have a known family history of the disease. However, lack of a known family history does not necessarily mean that a woman is at reduced risk. Certain inherited high penetrance gene mutations greatly increase breast cancer risk, the most dominant being mutations in the genes BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB-2. Women found to have mutations in these major genes may consider risk reduction strategies such as surgical removal of both breasts and/or chemoprevention. Mortality is reduced when breast cancer cases are detected and treated early. There are two components of early detection:  Signs and symptoms Most people will not experience any symptoms when the cancer is still early hence the importance of early detection.  Breast cancer can have combinations of symptoms, especially when it is more advanced. Symptoms of breast cancer can include: People with an abnormal breast lump should seek medical care, even if the lump does not hurt.  Most breast lumps are not cancer. Breast lumps that are cancerous are more likely to be successfully treated when they are small and have not spread to nearby lymph nodes.  Breast cancers may spread to other areas of the body and trigger other symptoms. Often, the most common first detectable site of spread is to the lymph nodes under the arm although it is possible to have cancer-bearing lymph nodes that cannot be felt.  Over time, cancerous cells may spread to other organs including the lungs, liver, brain and bones. Once they reach these sites, new cancer-related symptoms such as bone pain or headaches may appear.  Treatment for breast cancer depends on the subtype of cancer and how much it has spread outside of the breast to lymph nodes (stages II or III) or to other parts of the body (stage IV). octors combine treatments to minimize the chances of the cancer coming back (recurrence). These include: Treatments for breast cancer are more effective and are better tolerated when started early and taken to completion. The effectiveness of breast cancer therapies depends on completing the full course of treatment. Partial treatment is less likely to lead to a positive outcome. Surgery may remove just the cancerous tissue (called a lumpectomy) or the whole breast (mastectomy). Lymph nodes are removed at the time of cancer surgery for invasive cancers. Complete removal of the lymph node bed under the arm (complete axillary dissection) was thought to be necessary in the past to prevent the spread of cancer. A smaller lymph node procedure called “sentinel node biopsy” is now preferred as it has fewer complications. Radiation therapy treats residual microscopic cancers left behind in the breast tissue and/or lymph nodes and minimizes the chances of cancer recurring on the chest wall. Advanced cancers can erode through the skin to cause open sores (ulceration) but are not necessarily painful. Women with breast wounds that do not heal should seek medical care to have a biopsy performed. Medicines to treat breast cancers are selected based on the biological properties of the cancer as determined by special tests (tumour marker determination). The great majority of drugs used for breast cancer are already on the WHO Essential Medicines List (EML). Medical treatments for breast cancers, which may be given before (“neoadjuvant”) or after (“adjuvant”) surgery, are based on the biological subtyping of the cancers. Certain subtypes of breast cancer, such as triple negative (those that do not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER-2 receptor), are more aggressive than others.  Cancers that express the estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) are likely to respond to endocrine (hormone) therapies such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. These medicines are taken orally for 5–10 years and reduce the chance of recurrence of these “hormone-positive” cancers by nearly half. Endocrine therapies can cause symptoms of menopause but are generally well tolerated. Cancers that do not express ER or PR are “hormone receptor negative” and need to be treated with chemotherapy unless the cancer is very small. The chemotherapy regimens available today are very effective in reducing the chances of cancer spread or recurrence and are generally given as outpatient therapy, not requiring hospital admission in the absence of complications. Breast cancers that independently overexpress a molecule called the HER-2/neu oncogene (HER-2 positive) are amenable to treatment with targeted biological agents such as trastuzumab. When targeted biological therapies are given, they are combined with chemotherapy to make them effective at killing cancer cells. Radiotherapy plays a very important role in treating breast cancer. With early-stage breast cancers, radiation can prevent a woman having to undergo a mastectomy. With later stage cancers, radiotherapy can reduce cancer recurrence risk even when a mastectomy has been performed.  Early access to a multidisciplinary team that includes oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, dieticians/nutritionists, physical therapists, social workers, mental health, palliative care and rehabilitation teams both during and after completion of treatment helps improve outcomes. It also helps patients maintain or restore their functioning, independence and participation in meaningful life roles and community activities more quickly than might otherwise be the case.  Prehabilitation, including lifestyle-based interventions (exercise, diet and nutritional supplementation and psychological support) between diagnosis and treatment has proven effective in minimizing  complications related to the treatment.  Since the whole continuum of care is often complex, patient navigation helps streamline care pathways, improving health outcomes and patient satisfaction, and guiding individuals – especially in resource-limited or fragmented systems – through the cancer care continuum to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment completion. Benefits include increased screening rates, reduced hospital readmissions, better treatment understanding, and improved quality of life. Global impact Age-standardized breast cancer mortality in high-income countries dropped by 40% between the 1980s and 2020. Countries that have succeeded in reducing breast cancer mortality have been able to achieve an annual breast cancer mortality reduction of 2–4% per year.  The strategies for improving breast cancer outcomes depend on fundamental health system strengthening to deliver the treatments that are already known to work. These are also important for the management of other cancers and other  noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).  The establishment of reliable referral pathways from primary care facilities to secondary hospitals to dedicated cancer centres is the same approach as is required for the management of cervical cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. To that end, breast cancer is a so-called index disease whereby pathways are created that can be followed for the management of other cancers.  By providing public health education to improve awareness among women of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and, together with their families, understand the importance of early detection and treatment, more women would consult medical practitioners when breast cancer is first suspected, have access to clinical evaluation and diagnosis and get referral for timely treatment before any cancer present is advanced. This is possible even in the absence of mammographic screening that is impractical in many countries at the present time. In 2021, the World Health Organization established the Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI), to bring together stakeholders from around the world and across sectors with the shared goal of reducing global breast cancer mortality by 2.5% per year, thereby averting 2.5 million breast cancer deaths globally by 2040. The three pillars of action are: health promotion for early detection; timely diagnosis; and comprehensive breast cancer management.", "Overview": "Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked, the tumours can spread throughout the body and become fatal. Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts and/or the milk-producing lobules of the breast. The earliest form (in situ) is not life-threatening and can be detected in early stages. Cancer cells can spread into nearby breast tissue (invasion). This creates tumours that cause lumps or thickening.  Invasive cancers can spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs (metastasize). Metastasis can be life-threatening and fatal. Treatment is based on the person, the type of cancer and its spread. Treatment combines surgery, radiation therapy and medications. In 2022, there were an estimated 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 670 000 deaths globally. Breast cancer occurs in every country of the world in women at any age after puberty but with increasing rates in later life.   Global estimates reveal striking inequities in the breast cancer burden according to human development. For instance, in countries with a very high Human Development Index (HDI), 1 in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and 1 in 71 women die of it.  In contrast, in countries with a low HDI; while only 1 in 27 women is diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, 1 in 48 women will die from it. Female gender is the strongest breast cancer risk factor. Approximately 99% of breast cancers occur in women and 0.5–1% of breast cancers occur in men. The treatment of breast cancer in men follows the same principles of management as for women. Certain factors increase the risk of breast cancer including increasing age, obesity, harmful use of alcohol, family history of breast cancer, history of radiation exposure, reproductive history (such as age that menstrual periods began and age at first pregnancy), tobacco use and postmenopausal hormone therapy. Approximately half of breast cancers develop in women who have no identifiable breast cancer risk factor other than gender (female) and age (over 40 years).  Family history of breast cancer increases the risk of breast cancer, but most women diagnosed with breast cancer do not have a known family history of the disease. However, lack of a known family history does not necessarily mean that a woman is at reduced risk. Certain inherited high penetrance gene mutations greatly increase breast cancer risk, the most dominant being mutations in the genes BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB-2. Women found to have mutations in these major genes may consider risk reduction strategies such as surgical removal of both breasts and/or chemoprevention. Mortality is reduced when breast cancer cases are detected and treated early. There are two components of early detection:  Signs and symptoms Most people will not experience any symptoms when the cancer is still early hence the importance of early detection.  Breast cancer can have combinations of symptoms, especially when it is more advanced. Symptoms of breast cancer can include: People with an abnormal breast lump should seek medical care, even if the lump does not hurt.  Most breast lumps are not cancer. Breast lumps that are cancerous are more likely to be successfully treated when they are small and have not spread to nearby lymph nodes.  Breast cancers may spread to other areas of the body and trigger other symptoms. Often, the most common first detectable site of spread is to the lymph nodes under the arm although it is possible to have cancer-bearing lymph nodes that cannot be felt.  Over time, cancerous cells may spread to other organs including the lungs, liver, brain and bones. Once they reach these sites, new cancer-related symptoms such as bone pain or headaches may appear.  Treatment for breast cancer depends on the subtype of cancer and how much it has spread outside of the breast to lymph nodes (stages II or III) or to other parts of the body (stage IV). octors combine treatments to minimize the chances of the cancer coming back (recurrence). These include: Treatments for breast cancer are more effective and are better tolerated when started early and taken to completion. The effectiveness of breast cancer therapies depends on completing the full course of treatment. Partial treatment is less likely to lead to a positive outcome. Surgery may remove just the cancerous tissue (called a lumpectomy) or the whole breast (mastectomy). Lymph nodes are removed at the time of cancer surgery for invasive cancers. Complete removal of the lymph node bed under the arm (complete axillary dissection) was thought to be necessary in the past to prevent the spread of cancer. A smaller lymph node procedure called “sentinel node biopsy” is now preferred as it has fewer complications. Radiation therapy treats residual microscopic cancers left behind in the breast tissue and/or lymph nodes and minimizes the chances of cancer recurring on the chest wall. Advanced cancers can erode through the skin to cause open sores (ulceration) but are not necessarily painful. Women with breast wounds that do not heal should seek medical care to have a biopsy performed. Medicines to treat breast cancers are selected based on the biological properties of the cancer as determined by special tests (tumour marker determination). The great majority of drugs used for breast cancer are already on the WHO Essential Medicines List (EML). Medical treatments for breast cancers, which may be given before (“neoadjuvant”) or after (“adjuvant”) surgery, are based on the biological subtyping of the cancers. Certain subtypes of breast cancer, such as triple negative (those that do not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER-2 receptor), are more aggressive than others.  Cancers that express the estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) are likely to respond to endocrine (hormone) therapies such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. These medicines are taken orally for 5–10 years and reduce the chance of recurrence of these “hormone-positive” cancers by nearly half. Endocrine therapies can cause symptoms of menopause but are generally well tolerated. Cancers that do not express ER or PR are “hormone receptor negative” and need to be treated with chemotherapy unless the cancer is very small. The chemotherapy regimens available today are very effective in reducing the chances of cancer spread or recurrence and are generally given as outpatient therapy, not requiring hospital admission in the absence of complications. Breast cancers that independently overexpress a molecule called the HER-2/neu oncogene (HER-2 positive) are amenable to treatment with targeted biological agents such as trastuzumab. When targeted biological therapies are given, they are combined with chemotherapy to make them effective at killing cancer cells. Radiotherapy plays a very important role in treating breast cancer. With early-stage breast cancers, radiation can prevent a woman having to undergo a mastectomy. With later stage cancers, radiotherapy can reduce cancer recurrence risk even when a mastectomy has been performed.  Early access to a multidisciplinary team that includes oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, dieticians/nutritionists, physical therapists, social workers, mental health, palliative care and rehabilitation teams both during and after completion of treatment helps improve outcomes. It also helps patients maintain or restore their functioning, independence and participation in meaningful life roles and community activities more quickly than might otherwise be the case.  Prehabilitation, including lifestyle-based interventions (exercise, diet and nutritional supplementation and psychological support) between diagnosis and treatment has proven effective in minimizing  complications related to the treatment.  Since the whole continuum of care is often complex, patient navigation helps streamline care pathways, improving health outcomes and patient satisfaction, and guiding individuals – especially in resource-limited or fragmented systems – through the cancer care continuum to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment completion. Benefits include increased screening rates, reduced hospital readmissions, better treatment understanding, and improved quality of life.

{"title": "Blindness and vision impairment", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Vision, the most dominant of our senses, plays a critical role in every facet and stage of our lives. We take vision for granted, but without vision, we struggle to learn, to walk, to read, to participate in school and to work.  Vision impairment occurs when an eye condition affects the visual system and its vision functions. Everyone, if they live long enough, will experience at least one eye condition in their lifetime that will require appropriate care. Vision impairment has serious consequences for the individual across the life course. Many of these consequences can be mitigated by timely access to quality eye care. Eye conditions that can cause vision impairment and blindness – such as cataract or refractive error – are, for good reasons, the main focus of eye care strategies; nevertheless, the importance of eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment – such as dry eye or conjunctivitis – must not be overlooked. These conditions are frequently among the  leading reasons  for presentation to eye care services. Globally, the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness are: There is substantial variation in the causes of vision impairment between and within countries according to the availability of eye care services, their affordability, and the education of the population. For example, the proportion of vision impairment attributable to unoperated cataract is higher in low- and middle-income countries. In high income countries, diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration are more common. Among children, congenital cataract is a leading cause of vision impairment in low-income countries, whereas in middle-income countries it is more likely to be retinopathy of prematurity. Uncorrected refractive error remains a leading cause of vision impairment in all countries amongst children and adult populations. Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a near or distance vision impairment. In at least 1 billion – or almost half – of these cases, vision impairment could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. Among this 1 billion people, the main conditions causing distance vision impairment or blindness are cataract (94 million), refractive error (88.4 million), age-related macular degeneration (8 million), glaucoma (7.7 million), diabetic retinopathy (3.9 million)  (1) . The main condition causing near vision impairment is presbyopia (826 million)  (2) . In terms of regional differences, the prevalence of distance vision impairment in low- and middle-income regions is estimated to be 4 times higher than in high-income regions  (1) . With regards to near vision, rates of unaddressed near vision impairment are estimated to be greater than 80% in western, eastern and central sub-Saharan Africa, while comparative rates in high-income regions of North America, Australasia, western Europe, and of Asia-Pacific are reported to be lower than 10%  (2) . Population growth and ageing are expected to increase the risk that more people acquire vision impairment. Young children with early onset irreversible severe vision impairment can experience delayed motor, language, emotional, social and cognitive development, with lifelong consequences. School-age children with vision impairment can also experience lower levels of educational achievement. Vision impairment severely impacts quality of life among adult populations. Adults with vision impairment can experience lower rates of employment and higher rates of depression and anxiety. In the case of older adults, vision impairment can contribute to social isolation, difficulty walking, a higher risk of falls and fractures, and a greater likelihood of early entry into nursing or care homes. Vision impairment poses an enormous global financial burden with an estimate annual global productivity loss of about US$ 411 billion purchasing power parity  (3) . This figure far outweighs the estimated cost gap of addressing the unmet need of vision impairment ( estimated at about US$ 25 billion ). There are effective interventions covering promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation which address the needs associated with eye conditions and vision impairment. While many vision loss cases can be prevented (such as those due to infections, trauma, unsafe traditional medicines, perinatal diseases, nutrition-related diseases, unsafe use or self-administration of topical treatment), this is not possible for all. For many eye conditions, e.g. diabetic retinopathy, early detection and timely treatment are crucial to avoid irreversible vision loss. Spectacle correction for refractive error and surgery for cataract are among the most cost-effective of all health-care interventions. Yet,  globally only 36% of people  with a distance vision impairment due to refractive error have received access to an appropriate pair of spectacles and only 17% of people with vision impairment or blindness due to cataract have received access to quality surgery. Treatment is also available for many eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment, such as dry eye, conjunctivitis and blepharitis, but generate discomfort and pain. Treatment of these conditions is directed at alleviating the symptoms and preventing the evolution towards more severe stages of those diseases. Vision rehabilitation is very effective in improving functioning for people with an irreversible vision loss that can be caused by eye conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, consequences of trauma, and age-related macular degeneration. WHO’s work is guided by the recommendations of the  WHO World report on vision (2019)  and the resolution on  \"integrated, people-centred eye care, including preventable blindness and vision impairment\"  adopted at the Seventy-third World Health Assembly in 2020. The key proposal is to make integrated people-centred eye care (IPEC) the care model of choice and to ensure its widespread implementation. It is expected that by shaping the global agenda on vision and eye care, the report and resolution will assist Member States and their partners in their efforts to reduce the burden of eye conditions and vision.

For example, the proportion of vision impairment attributable to unoperated cataract is higher in low- and middle-income countries. In high income countries, diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration are more common. Among children, congenital cataract is a leading cause of vision impairment in low-income countries, whereas in middle-income countries it is more likely to be retinopathy of prematurity. Uncorrected refractive error remains a leading cause of vision impairment in all countries amongst children and adult populations.

{"title": "Autism", "summary": null, "sections": {"Causes": "Available scientific evidence suggests that there are probably many factors that make a child more likely to have autism, including environmental and genetic factors. Scientific studies show that exposure to certain environmental factors appear to occur more frequently in children with autism, or their parents. These include advanced parental age, maternal diabetes during pregnancy, prenatal exposure to air pollutants or certain heavy metals, prematurity, severe birth complications and low birth weight. In addition, research studies have looked into possible association between use of various medicine during pregnancy and increased risk for autism. For example, prenatal exposure to valproate and carbamazepine, which are used for seizures, appear to occur more frequently in children with autism.  More research is needed to better understand the role of each of the factors that appear to be associated with a higher risk for autism, and how they interact with genetic variations. Extensive research using a variety of different methods and conducted over many years has demonstrated that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine does not cause autism (2,3). The study that was interpreted as indicating any such link was later proven to be wrong and fraudulent. The journal that published it withdrew the study, and the doctor who authored it lost his medical license  (4,5,6) . Evidence also shows that other childhood vaccines do not increase the risk of autism. Extensive research into the preservative thiomersal and the additive aluminium that are contained in some vaccines strongly concluded that these constituents in childhood vaccines do not increase the risk of autism. Assessment and care A broad range of interventions, from early childhood and across the life span, can optimize the development, health, well-being and quality of life of autistic people. Timely access to early evidence-based psychosocial interventions can improve the ability\r\n    of autistic children to communicate effectively and interact socially. The monitoring of child development as part of routine maternal and child health care is recommended. It is important that, once autism has been diagnosed, children, adolescents and adults with autism and their carers are offered relevant information, services, referrals, and practical support, in accordance with their individual and evolving needs and\r\n    preferences. The health-care needs of people with autism are complex and require a range of integrated services, that include health promotion, care and rehabilitation. Collaboration between the health sector and other sectors, particularly education, employment and\r\n    social care, is important. Interventions for people with autism and other developmental disabilities need to be designed and delivered with the participation of people living with these conditions. Care needs to be accompanied by actions at community and societal levels for greater accessibility, inclusivity and support. Human rights All people, including people with autism, have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. And yet, autistic people are often subject to stigma and discrimination, including unjust deprivation of health care, education and opportunities to engage and participate in their communities. People with autism have the same health problems as the general population. However, they may, in addition, have specific health-care needs related to autism or other co-occurring conditions. They may be more vulnerable to developing chronic noncommunicable\r\n    conditions because of behavioural risk factors such as physical inactivity and poor dietary preferences, and are at greater risk of violence, injury and abuse. Autistic people are more likely to die prematurely. People with autism require accessible health services for general health-care needs like the rest of the population, including promotive and preventive services and treatment of acute and chronic illness. Nevertheless, autistic people have higher rates\r\n    of unmet health-care needs compared with the general population. They are also more vulnerable during humanitarian emergencies. A common barrier is created by health-care providers’ inadequate knowledge and understanding of autism. WHO resolution on autism spectrum disorders  In May 2014, the Sixty-seventh World Health Assembly adopted a resolution entitled  Comprehensive and coordinated efforts for the management of autism spectrum disorders ,\r\n which was supported by more than 60 countries. The resolution urges WHO to collaborate with Member States and partner agencies to strengthen national capacities to address ASD and other developmental disabilities. WHO response WHO and partners recognize the need to strengthen countries' abilities to promote the optimal health and well-being of all autistic people. WHO's efforts focus on: The WHO Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030  and the  Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders  calls on countries to address the current significant\r\n    gaps in early detection, care, treatment and rehabilitation for mental and neurodevelopmental conditions, which include autism. It also calls for counties to address the social, economic, educational and inclusion needs of people living with mental\r\n    and neurological disorders, and their families, and to improve surveillance and relevant research.", "Video": "Training for caregivers of children with development delays and disabilities"}, "url": "https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/autism-spectrum-disorders"},
{"title": "Asthma", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Asthma is a chronic lung disease affecting people of all ages. It is caused by inflammation and muscle tightening around the airways, which makes it harder to breathe.  Symptoms can include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. These symptoms can be mild or severe and can come and go over time.  Although asthma can be a serious condition, it can be managed with the right treatment. People with symptoms of asthma should speak to a health professional. Asthma is often under-diagnosed and under-treated, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. People with under-treated asthma can suffer sleep disturbance, tiredness during the day, and poor concentration. Asthma sufferers and their families may miss school and work, with financial impact on the family and wider community. If symptoms are severe, people with asthma may need to receive emergency health care and they may be admitted to hospital for treatment and monitoring. In the most severe cases, asthma can lead to death. Symptoms of asthma can vary from person to person. Symptoms sometimes get significantly worse. This is known as an asthma attack. Symptoms are often worse at night or during exercise. Common symptoms of asthma include: Some people will have worse symptoms when they have a cold or during changes in the weather. Other triggers can include dust, smoke, fumes, grass and tree pollen, animal fur and feathers, strong soaps and perfume. Symptoms can be caused by other conditions as well. People with symptoms should talk to a healthcare provider. Many factors have been linked to an increased risk of developing asthma, although it is often difficult to find a single, direct cause. Asthma cannot be cured but there are several treatments available. The most common treatment is to use an inhaler, which delivers medication directly to the lungs.  Inhalers can help control the disease and enable people with asthma to enjoy a normal, active life.  There are two main types of inhaler:  People with asthma may need to use their inhaler every day. Their treatment will depend on the frequency of symptoms and the types of inhalers available. Using an inhaler can be difficult, especially for children and during emergency situations. Using a spacer device makes it easier to use an aerosol inhaler. This helps the medicine to reach the lungs more easily. A spacer is a plastic container with a mouthpiece or mask at one end and a hole for the inhaler in the other. A homemade spacer, made from a 500ml plastic bottle, can be as effective as commercially manufactured spacers.  Access to inhalers is a problem in many countries. In 2021, bronchodilators were available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries, and steroid inhalers available in one third.   It is also important to raise community awareness to reduce the myths and stigma associated with asthma in some settings. People with asthma and their families need education to understand more about their asthma. This includes their treatment options, triggers to avoid, and how to manage their symptoms at home.  It is important for people with asthma to know how to increase their treatment when their symptoms are worsening to avoid a serious attack. Healthcare providers may give an asthma action plan to help people with asthma to take greater control of their treatment.   Asthma is included in the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. WHO is taking action to extend diagnosis of and treatment for asthma in a number of ways. The WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (PEN) was developed to help improve NCD management in primary health care in low-resource settings. PEN includes protocols for the assessment, diagnosis and management of chronic respiratory diseases (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and modules on healthy lifestyle counselling, including tobacco cessation and self-care.  Reducing tobacco smoke exposure is important for both primary prevention of asthma and disease management. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is enabling progress in this area as are WHO initiatives such as MPOWER and mTobacco Cessation. Air pollution is an important risk factor for asthma, causing new cases and making existing disease worse. WHO has developed training for health care workers on air pollution which highlights this link and offers practical advice to reduce and mitigate exposure.     References 1.

Other triggers can include dust, smoke, fumes, grass and tree pollen, animal fur and feathers, strong soaps and perfume. Symptoms can be caused by other conditions as well. People with symptoms should talk to a healthcare provider. Many factors have been linked to an increased risk of developing asthma, although it is often difficult to find a single, direct cause. Asthma cannot be cured but there are several treatments available. The most common treatment is to use an inhaler, which delivers medication directly to the lungs.  Inhalers can help control the disease and enable people with asthma to enjoy a normal, active life.  There are two main types of inhaler:  People with asthma may need to use their inhaler every day. Their treatment will depend on the frequency of symptoms and the types of inhalers available. Using an inhaler can be difficult, especially for children and during emergency situations. Using a spacer device makes it easier to use an aerosol inhaler. This helps the medicine to reach the lungs more easily. A spacer is a plastic container with a mouthpiece or mask at one end and a hole for the inhaler in the other. A homemade spacer, made from a 500ml plastic bottle, can be as effective as commercially manufactured spacers.  Access to inhalers is a problem in many countries. In 2021, bronchodilators were available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries, and steroid inhalers available in one third.   It is also important to raise community awareness to reduce the myths and stigma associated with asthma in some settings. People with asthma and their families need education to understand more about their asthma. This includes their treatment options, triggers to avoid, and how to manage their symptoms at home.  It is important for people with asthma to know how to increase their treatment when their symptoms are worsening to avoid a serious attack. Healthcare providers may give an asthma action plan to help people with asthma to take greater control of their treatment.   Asthma is included in the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. WHO is taking action to extend diagnosis of and treatment for asthma in a number of ways. The WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (PEN) was developed to help improve NCD management in primary health care in low-resource settings. PEN includes protocols for the assessment, diagnosis and management of chronic respiratory diseases (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and modules on healthy lifestyle counselling, including tobacco cessation and self-care.  Reducing tobacco smoke exposure is important for both primary prevention of asthma and disease management. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is enabling progress in this area as are WHO initiatives such as MPOWER and mTobacco Cessation. Air pollution is an important risk factor for asthma, causing new cases and making existing disease worse. WHO has developed training for health care workers on air pollution which highlights this link and offers practical advice to reduce and mitigate exposure.     References 1.

{"title": "Anxiety disorders", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Everyone can feel anxious sometimes, but people with anxiety disorders often experience fear and worry that is both intense and excessive. These feelings are typically accompanied by physical tension and other behavioural and cognitive symptoms. They are difficult to control, cause significant distress and can last a long time if untreated. Anxiety disorders interfere with daily activities and can impair a person’s family, social and school or working life. An estimated 4.4% of the global population currently experience an anxiety disorder  (1) . In 2021, 359 million people in the world had an anxiety disorder, making anxiety disorders the most common of all mental disorders  (1) .  Although highly effective treatments for anxiety disorders exist, only about 1 in 4 people in need (27.6%) receive any treatment  (2) . Barriers to care include lack of awareness that this is a treatable health condition, lack of investment in mental health services, lack of trained health-care providers, and social stigma. People with an anxiety disorder may experience excessive fear or worry about a specific situation (for example, a panic attack or social situation) or, in the case of generalized anxiety disorder, about a broad range of everyday situations. They typically experience these symptoms over an extended period – at least several months. Usually they avoid the situations that make them anxious.  Other symptoms of anxiety disorders may include: Anxiety disorders increase the risk for depression and substance use disorders as well as the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, including:  People may experience more than one anxiety disorder at the same time. Symptoms often begin during childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood. Girls and women are more likely to experience an anxiety disorder than boys and men. Anxiety disorders, like other mental health conditions, result from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. Anyone can have an anxiety disorder, but people who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other adverse experiences are more likely to develop one.  Anxiety disorders are closely related to and affected by physical health. Many of the impacts of anxiety (such as physical tension, nervous system hyperactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease. In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing anxiety disorders due to the difficulties associated with managing their conditions. Effective community-based approaches to prevent anxiety include parental education and school-based programmes to enhance social and emotional learning and build positive coping in children and adolescents. Exercise programmes can also be effective in preventing anxiety disorders in adults.  There are several effective treatments for anxiety disorders. People with symptoms of anxiety should seek care.  Psychological interventions  are essential treatments for anxiety disorders and refer primarily to talk therapy with professionals or supervised lay therapists. These interventions can help people learn new ways of thinking, coping or relating to their anxiety, to others or to the world. They can teach people how to face the situations, events, people or places that trigger their anxiety.  Psychological interventions can be provided to individuals or groups, in person or online. They may also be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps. The psychological interventions with the most evidence for treating a range of anxiety disorders are those based on principles of cognitive-behavioural therapy. These include exposure therapy, during which people learn to face their fears. In addition, learning stress management skills, such as relaxation skills and mindfulness skills, can help reduce symptoms of anxiety disorders.  Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can also be useful in treating adults with anxiety disorders. Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, and/or treatment availability), and individual preferences.  Benzodiazepines, which have historically been prescribed for anxiety disorders, are generally not recommended for anxiety disorders because of their high potential for dependence as well as their limited long-term effectiveness. Self-care can play an important role in supporting treatment. To help manage your symptoms of anxiety and promote your overall well-being, you can: WHO’s  Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030  highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders.  Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are included in the priority conditions covered by WHO’s  mhGAP Programme . This programme aims to help countries increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders through care provided by health workers who are not specialists in mental health.  WHO has developed brief psychological intervention manuals that may be delivered by lay therapists to individuals and groups. These interventions have been shown to be effective for multiple mental health problems, including anxiety and depression. An example is the  Problem Management Plus (PM+) manual , which is based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy and uses techniques like stress management, problem solving treatment and strengthening social support. Additionally, the  Self-Help Plus (SH+)  group-based stress management course and WHO’s popular  Doing What Matters in Times of Stress  self-help book describe skills that can be used to reduce anxiety and stress.    (1) 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) [online database].

People with symptoms of anxiety should seek care.  Psychological interventions  are essential treatments for anxiety disorders and refer primarily to talk therapy with professionals or supervised lay therapists. These interventions can help people learn new ways of thinking, coping or relating to their anxiety, to others or to the world. They can teach people how to face the situations, events, people or places that trigger their anxiety.  Psychological interventions can be provided to individuals or groups, in person or online. They may also be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps. The psychological interventions with the most evidence for treating a range of anxiety disorders are those based on principles of cognitive-behavioural therapy. These include exposure therapy, during which people learn to face their fears. In addition, learning stress management skills, such as relaxation skills and mindfulness skills, can help reduce symptoms of anxiety disorders.  Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can also be useful in treating adults with anxiety disorders. Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, and/or treatment availability), and individual preferences.  Benzodiazepines, which have historically been prescribed for anxiety disorders, are generally not recommended for anxiety disorders because of their high potential for dependence as well as their limited long-term effectiveness. Self-care can play an important role in supporting treatment. To help manage your symptoms of anxiety and promote your overall well-being, you can: WHO’s  Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030  highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders.  Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are included in the priority conditions covered by WHO’s  mhGAP Programme . This programme aims to help countries increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders through care provided by health workers who are not specialists in mental health.  WHO has developed brief psychological intervention manuals that may be delivered by lay therapists to individuals and groups. These interventions have been shown to be effective for multiple mental health problems, including anxiety and depression. An example is the  Problem Management Plus (PM+) manual , which is based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy and uses techniques like stress management, problem solving treatment and strengthening social support.

{"title": "Anaemia", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the haemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. It mainly affects women and children. Anaemia occurs when there isn’t enough haemoglobin in the body to carry oxygen to the organs and tissues. In severe cases, anaemia can cause poor cognitive and motor development in children. It can also cause problems for pregnant women and their babies. Anaemia can be caused by poor nutrition, infections, chronic diseases, heavy menstruation, pregnancy issues and family history. It is often caused by a lack of iron in the blood. Anaemia is preventable and treatable. In many low- and lower-middle income settings, the most commonly- recognized causes of anaemia are iron deficiency and malaria. The population groups most vulnerable to anaemia include children under 5 years of age, particularly infants and children under 2 years of age, menstruating adolescent girls and women, and pregnant and postpartum women. Anaemia is estimated to affect half a billion women 15–49 years of age and 269 million children 6–59 months of age worldwide. In 2019, 30% (539 million) of non-pregnant women and 37% (32 million) of pregnant women aged 15–49 years were affected by anaemia.    The WHO Regions of Africa and South-East Asia are most affected with an estimated 106 million women and 103 million children affected by anaemia in Africa and 244 million women and 83 million children affected in South-East Asia. Common and non-specific symptoms of anaemia include:  Severe anaemia can cause more serious symptoms including: Anaemia is diagnosed based on blood haemoglobin concentrations falling below specified thresholds established based on age, sex, and physiological status. It is considered a symptom of an underlying condition(s). Anaemia may be caused by several factors: nutrient deficiencies, inadequate diet (or the inadequate absorption of nutrients), infections, inflammation, chronic diseases, gynaecological and obstetric conditions, and inherited red blood cell disorders. Iron deficiency, primarily due to inadequate dietary iron intake, is considered the most common nutritional deficiency leading to anaemia. Deficiencies in vitamin A, folate, vitamin B12 and riboflavin can also result in anaemia due to their specific roles in the synthesis of haemoglobin and/or erythrocyte production. Additional mechanisms include nutrient losses (e.g. blood loss from parasitic infections, haemorrhage associated with childbirth, or menstrual loss), impaired absorption, low iron stores at birth, and nutrient interactions affecting iron bioavailability. Infections can be another important cause of anaemia, depending on the local burden of infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and parasitic infections. Infections can impair nutrient absorption and metabolism (e.g. malaria, ascariasis) or can cause nutrient loss (e.g. schistosomiasis, hookworm infection). Many different chronic conditions can cause inflammation and lead to anaemia of inflammation or anaemia of chronic disease. HIV infection causes anaemia through a wide range of mechanisms including ineffective production or excessive destruction of red blood cells, blood loss, and side effects of the drug treatment. Consistent heavy menstrual losses, maternal blood volume expansion during pregnancy, and blood loss during and after childbirth, particularly in cases of postpartum haemorrhage, commonly lead to anaemia. Additionally, in some regions, inherited red blood cell disorders are a common cause of anaemia. These include conditions such as α- and β-thalassemia due to abnormalities of haemoglobin synthesis, sickle cell disorders due to changes in the haemoglobin structure, other haemoglobinopathies due to haemoglobin gene variants, abnormalities of red cell enzymes, or abnormalities of the red blood cell membrane. The treatment and prevention of anaemia depend on the underlying cause of the condition. There are many effective ways to treat and prevent anaemia.  Changes in diet can help reduce anaemia in some cases, including: Other health conditions can cause anaemia. Actions include: There are several ways to help prevent and manage anaemia in daily life, including eating a healthy and diverse diet and speaking to a health-care provider early if you have symptoms of anaemia. To keep a healthy and diverse diet: If you take calcium and iron supplements, take them at different times during the day. People with heavy menstrual bleeding should see their doctor for treatment. Doctors may recommend iron supplements or hormonal contraceptives.  Some infections can cause anaemia. Wash your hands with soap and water and use clean toilets to reduce the risk of infection. Malaria can also cause anaemia. People living in places where malaria is common should follow prevention advice from local health authorities. Seek prompt treatment if you suspect you have malaria. The consequences of anaemia can vary. It can affect school performance (through developmental delays and behavioural disturbances such as decreased motor activity, social interaction and attention to tasks), productivity in adult life and overall quality of life in general.  During pregnancy, anaemia has been associated with poor maternal and birth outcomes, including premature birth, low birth weight and maternal mortality. In addition to the health consequences, anaemia can have important financial impacts for individuals, families, communities and countries. It is estimated that for every US$ 1 invested in reducing anaemia in women, US$ 12 in economic returns could potentially be produced  (2) .  Anaemia reduction is included as one of six World Health Assembly Global Nutrition Targets within the  Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition . Additionally, anaemia in women 15–49 years of age is one of the targets for the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. WHO has committed to supporting countries to reduce anaemia.

{"title": "Alcohol", "summary": null, "sections": {"Overview": "Alcohol and alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, which is a psychoactive and toxic substance with dependence-producing properties. Alcohol has been widely used in many cultures for centuries, but it is associated with significant health risks and harms.  Worldwide, 2.6 million deaths were attributable to alcohol consumption in 2019, of which 2 million were among men and 0.6 million among women. The highest levels of alcohol-related deaths per 100 000 persons are observed in the WHO European and African Regions with 52.9 deaths and 52.2 deaths per 100 000 people, respectively. People of younger age (20–39 years) are disproportionately affected by alcohol consumption with the highest proportion (13%) of alcohol-attributable deaths occurring within this age group in 2019. The data on global alcohol consumption in 2019 shows that an estimated 400 million people aged 15 years and older live with alcohol use disorders, and an estimated 209 million live with alcohol dependence. There has been some progress; from 2010 to 2019, the number of alcohol-attributable deaths per 100 000 people decreased by 20.2% globally.  There has been a steady increase in the number of countries developing national alcohol policies. Almost all countries implement alcohol excise taxes. However, countries report continued interference from the alcohol industry in policy development. Based on 2019 data, about 54% out of 145 reporting countries had national guidelines/standards for specialized treatment services for alcohol use disorders, but only 46% of countries had legal regulations to protect the confidentiality of people in treatment.   Access to screening, brief intervention and treatment for people with hazardous alcohol use and alcohol use disorder remains very low, as well as access to medications for treatment of alcohol use disorders. Overall, the proportion of people with alcohol use disorders in contact with treatment services varies from less than 1% to no more than 14% in all countries where such data are available. Alcohol consumption is found to play a causal role in more than 200 diseases, injuries and other health conditions. However, the global burden of disease and injuries caused by alcohol consumption can be quantified for only 31 health conditions on the basis of the available scientific evidence for the role of alcohol use in their development, occurrence and outcomes.  Drinking alcohol is associated with risks of developing noncommunicable diseases such as liver diseases, heart diseases, and different types of cancers, as well as mental health and behavioural conditions such as depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders. An estimated 474 000 deaths from cardiovascular diseases were caused by alcohol consumption in 2019.  Alcohol is an established carcinogen and alcohol consumption increases the risk of several cancers, including breast, liver, head and neck, oesophageal and colorectal cancers. In 2019, 4.4% of cancers diagnosed globally and 401 000 cancer deaths were attributed to alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption also causes significant harm to others, not just to the person consuming alcohol. A significant part of alcohol-attributable disease burden arises from injuries such as road traffic accidents. In 2019, of a total of 298 000 deaths from alcohol-related road crashes, 156 000 deaths were caused by someone else’s drinking.  Other injuries, intentional or unintentional, include falls, drowning, burns, sexual assault, intimate partner violence and suicide.  A causal relationship has been established between alcohol use and the incidence or outcomes of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the risk of having a child with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), the most severe form of which is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is associated with developmental disabilities and birth defects. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can also increase the risk of pre-term birth complications including miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery.  Younger people are disproportionately negatively affected by alcohol consumption, with the highest proportion (13%) of alcohol-attributable deaths in 2019 occurring among people aged between 20 and 39 years. In the long term, harmful and hazardous levels of alcohol consumption can lead to social problems including family problems, issues at work, financial problems, and unemployment. There is no form of alcohol consumption that is risk-free. Even low levels of alcohol consumption carry some risks and can cause harm. The level of risk depends on several factors, including the amount consumed, frequency of drinking, the health status of the individual, age, sex, and other personal characteristics, as well as the context in which alcohol consumption occurs.  Some groups and individuals who are vulnerable or at risk may have a higher susceptibility to the toxic, psychoactive and dependence-inducing properties of alcohol. On the other hand, individuals who adopt lower-risk patterns of alcohol consumption may not necessarily face a significantly increased likelihood of negative health and social consequences. Societal factors which affect the levels and patterns of alcohol consumption and related problems include cultural and social norms, availability of alcohol, level of economic development, and implementation and enforcement of alcohol policies.  The impact of alcohol consumption on chronic and acute health outcomes is largely determined by the total volume of alcohol consumed and the pattern of drinking, particularly those patterns which are associated with the frequency of drinking and episodes of heavy drinking. Most alcohol related harms come from heavy episodic or heavy continuous alcohol consumption. The context plays an important role in the occurrence of alcohol-related harm, particularly as a result of alcohol intoxication. Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of diseases, injuries and other health conditions, but also on their outcomes and how these evolve over time. There are gender differences in both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related mortality and morbidity. In 2019, 52% of men were current drinkers, while only 35% of women had been drinking alcohol in the last 12 months. Alcohol per capita consumption was, on average, 8.2 litres for men compared to 2.2 litres for women. In 2019, alcohol use was responsible for 6.7% of all deaths among men and 2.4% of all deaths among women.  The Global alcohol action plan 2022–2030, endorsed by WHO Member States, aims to reduce the harmful use of alcohol through effective, evidence-based strategies at national, regional and global levels. The plan outlines six key areas for action: high-impact strategies and interventions, advocacy and awareness, partnership and coordination, technical support and capacity-building, knowledge production and information systems, and resource mobilization.  Implementation of global strategy and action plan will accelerate global progress towards attaining alcohol-related targets under the Sustainable Development Goal 3.5 on strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol.  Achieving this will require global, regional and national actions on the levels, patterns and contexts of alcohol consumption and the wider social determinants of health, with a particular focus on implementing high-impact cost effective interventions.   It is vital to address the determinants that drive the acceptability, availability and affordability of alcohol consumption through cross-sectoral, comprehensive and integrated policy measures. It is also of critical importance to achieve universal health coverage for people living with alcohol use disorders and other health conditions due to alcohol use by strengthening health system responses and developing comprehensive and accessible systems of treatment and care that for those in need. The SAFER initiative, launched in 2018 by WHO and partners, supports countries to implement the high-impact, cost-effective interventions proven to reduce the harm caused by alcohol consumption.  The WHO Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH) presents data on levels and patterns of alcohol consumption, alcohol-attributable health and social consequences and policy responses across the world. Achieving a reduction in the harmful use of alcohol in line with the targets included in the Global alcohol action plan, the SDG 2030 agenda and the WHO Global monitoring framework for noncommunicable diseases, requires concerted action by countries and effective global governance.   Public policies and interventions to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm should be guided and formulated by public health interests and based on clear public health goals and the best available evidence.  Engaging all relevant stakeholders is essential but the potential conflicts of interest, particularly with the alcohol industry, must be carefully assessed before engagement. Economic operators should refrain from activities that might prevent, delay or stop the development, enactment, implementation and enforcement of high-impact strategies and interventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol.   By working together, with due diligence and protection from conflicts of interest, the negative health and social consequences of alcohol can be effectively reduced.", "Health risks of alcohol use": "Alcohol consumption is found to play a causal role in more than 200 diseases, injuries and other health conditions. However, the global burden of disease and injuries caused by alcohol consumption can be quantified for only 31 health conditions on the basis of the available scientific evidence for the role of alcohol use in their development, occurrence and outcomes.  Drinking alcohol is associated with risks of developing noncommunicable diseases such as liver diseases, heart diseases, and different types of cancers, as well as mental health and behavioural conditions such as depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders. An estimated 474 000 deaths from cardiovascular diseases were caused by alcohol consumption in 2019.  Alcohol is an established carcinogen and alcohol consumption increases the risk of several cancers, including breast, liver, head and neck, oesophageal and colorectal cancers. In 2019, 4.4% of cancers diagnosed globally and 401 000 cancer deaths were attributed to alcohol consumption.

{"title": "Abortion", "summary": null, "sections": {"Key facts": "Around 73 million induced abortions take place worldwide each year. Six out of 10 (61%) of all unintended pregnancies, and 3 out of 10 (29%) of all pregnancies, end in induced abortion  (1) . Comprehensive abortion care is included in the  list of essential health care services  published by WHO in 2020. Abortion is a simple health care intervention that can be safely and effectively managed by a wide range of health workers using medication or a surgical procedure. In the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a medical abortion can also be\r\n    safely self-managed by the pregnant person outside of a health care facility (e.g. at home), in whole or in part. This requires that the woman has access to accurate information, quality medicines and support from a trained health worker (if she\r\n    needs or wants it during the process). Comprehensive abortion care includes the provision of information, abortion management and post-abortion care. Abortion management includes induced abortion (the deliberate interruption of an ongoing pregnancy by medical or surgical means), care related to pregnancy loss (e.g., miscarriage/spontaneous abortion, missed abortion and intrauterine fetal demise), and management of complications after an abortion. The information in this fact sheet focuses on care related to induced abortion. When carried out using a method recommended by WHO appropriate to the pregnancy duration, and by someone with the necessary skills, abortion is a safe health care intervention  (2).   However, when people with unintended pregnancies face barriers to attaining safe, timely, affordable, geographically reachable, respectful and non-discriminatory abortion care, they may resort to unsafe abortion. 1 Global estimates from 2010–2014 demonstrate that 45% of all induced abortions are unsafe. Of all unsafe abortions, one third were performed under the least safe conditions, i.e. by untrained persons using dangerous and invasive methods. More than half of all these unsafe abortions occurred in Asia, most of them in south and central Asia. In Latin America and Africa, the majority (approximately 3 out of 4) of all abortions were unsafe. In Africa, nearly half of all abortions occurred under the least safe circumstances  (3) . Lack of access to safe, affordable, timely and respectful abortion care, and the stigma associated with abortion, pose risks to women’s physical and mental well-being throughout the life-course.  Inaccessibility of quality abortion care risks violating a range of human rights of women and girls, including the right to life; the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; the right to benefit from scientific progress\r\n    and its realization; the right to decide freely and responsibly on the number, spacing and timing of children; and the right to be free from torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment.  Maternal deaths due to unsafe abortion are often misclassified and underreported due to stigma. A review from 2009–20 found that 8% of maternal deaths were linked to abortion  (4). While deaths from safe abortion are negligible, <1/100 000, in regions where unsafe abortions are common, the death rates are high, at > 200/100 000 abortions  (4) . Estimates from 2012 indicate that in developing countries alone, 7 million women per year were treated in hospital facilities for complications of unsafe abortion  (5) . Physical health risks associated with unsafe abortion include: Restrictive abortion regulation can cause distress and stigma, and risk constituting a violation of human rights of women and girls, including the right to privacy and the right to non-discrimination and equality, while also imposing financial burdens on women and girls. Regulations that force women to travel to attain legal care, or require mandatory counselling or waiting periods, lead to loss of income and other financial costs, and can make abortion inaccessible to women with low resources  (6,7) . Estimates from 2006 show that complications of unsafe abortions cost health systems in developing countries US$ 553 million per year for post-abortion treatments  (8) . In addition, households experienced US$ 922 million in loss of income due to long-term disability related to unsafe abortion  (8) . Countries and health systems could make substantial monetary savings by providing greater access to modern contraception and quality induced abortion  (7,9) . A scoping review from 2021 also indicates that legalization of abortion affects women’s education, participation in the labour market and positively contributes to GDP growth  (9) . The legal status of abortion can further affect children’s educational outcomes, and their earnings in the labour market later in life. By reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and thus increasing the likelihood that children are born wanted, legalization of abortion can be linked to greater parental investments in children, including in girls’ schooling  (9) .\r\n Evidence shows that restricting access to abortions does not reduce the number of abortions  (1) ; however, it does affect whether the abortions that women and girls attain are safe and dignified. The proportion of unsafe abortions are significantly higher in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws than in countries with less restrictive laws  (3) . Barriers to accessing safe and respectful abortion include high costs, stigma for those seeking abortions and health care workers, and the refusal of health workers to provide an abortion based on personal conscience or religious belief. Access is further impeded by restrictive laws and requirements that are not medically justified, including criminalization of abortion, mandatory waiting periods, provision of biased information or counselling, third-party authorization and restrictions regarding the type of health care providers or facilities that can provide abortion services. Multiple actions are needed at the legal, health system and community levels so that everyone who needs abortion care has access to it. The three cornerstones of an enabling environment for quality comprehensive abortion care are: A well-functioning health system implies many factors, including:  Availability and accessibility of information implies:  WHO provides global technical and policy guidance on the use of contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy, provision of information on abortion care, abortion management (including miscarriage, induced abortion, incomplete abortion and fetal death) and post-abortion care. In 2022, WHO published an updated, consolidated guideline on abortion care, including all WHO recommendations and best practice statements across three domains essential to the provision of abortion care: law and policy, clinical services and service delivery. A  second edition  was released in 2025. WHO also maintains the  Global Abortion Policies Database . This interactive online database contains comprehensive information on the abortion laws, policies, health standards and guidelines for all countries. Upon request, WHO provides technical support to countries to adapt sexual and reproductive health guidelines to specific contexts and strengthen national policies and programmes related to contraception and safe abortion care. A quality abortion care monitoring and evaluation framework is also in development. WHO is a cosponsor of the  HRP (UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction) , which carries\r\n    out research on clinical care, abortion regulation, abortion stigma, as well as implementation research on community and health systems approaches to quality abortion care. It also monitors the global burden of unsafe abortion and its consequences.   1  An “unsafe abortion” is defined as a procedure for terminating a pregnancy performed by persons lacking the necessary information or skills or in an environment not in conformity with minimal medical standards, or both. The persons, skills and medical standards considered safe in the provision of abortion are different for medical and surgical abortion and by pregnancy duration. In using this definition, what is considered ‘safe’ or unsafe needs to be interpreted in line with the most current WHO technical and policy guidance  (2).

In 2022, WHO published an updated, consolidated guideline on abortion care, including all WHO recommendations and best practice statements across three domains essential to the provision of abortion care: law and policy, clinical services and service delivery. A  second edition  was released in 2025. WHO also maintains the  Global Abortion Policies Database . This interactive online database contains comprehensive information on the abortion laws, policies, health standards and guidelines for all countries. Upon request, WHO provides technical support to countries to adapt sexual and reproductive health guidelines to specific contexts and strengthen national policies and programmes related to contraception and safe abortion care. A quality abortion care monitoring and evaluation framework is also in development. WHO is a cosponsor of the  HRP (UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction) , which carries\r\n    out research on clinical care, abortion regulation, abortion stigma, as well as implementation research on community and health systems approaches to quality abortion care. It also monitors the global burden of unsafe abortion and its consequences.   1  An “unsafe abortion” is defined as a procedure for terminating a pregnancy performed by persons lacking the necessary information or skills or in an environment not in conformity with minimal medical standards, or both. The persons, skills and medical standards considered safe in the provision of abortion are different for medical and surgical abortion and by pregnancy duration. In using this definition, what is considered ‘safe’ or unsafe needs to be interpreted in line with the most current WHO technical and policy guidance  (2).

PMID: 33956826; PMCID: PMC8101771.", "Scope of the problem": "When carried out using a method recommended by WHO appropriate to the pregnancy duration, and by someone with the necessary skills, abortion is a safe health care intervention  (2).   However, when people with unintended pregnancies face barriers to attaining safe, timely, affordable, geographically reachable, respectful and non-discriminatory abortion care, they may resort to unsafe abortion. 1 Global estimates from 2010–2014 demonstrate that 45% of all induced abortions are unsafe. Of all unsafe abortions, one third were performed under the least safe conditions, i.e. by untrained persons using dangerous and invasive methods. More than half of all these unsafe abortions occurred in Asia, most of them in south and central Asia. In Latin America and Africa, the majority (approximately 3 out of 4) of all abortions were unsafe. In Africa, nearly half of all abortions occurred under the least safe circumstances  (3) . Lack of access to safe, affordable, timely and respectful abortion care, and the stigma associated with abortion, pose risks to women’s physical and mental well-being throughout the life-course.  Inaccessibility of quality abortion care risks violating a range of human rights of women and girls, including the right to life; the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; the right to benefit from scientific progress\r\n    and its realization; the right to decide freely and responsibly on the number, spacing and timing of children; and the right to be free from torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment.  Maternal deaths due to unsafe abortion are often misclassified and underreported due to stigma. A review from 2009–20 found that 8% of maternal deaths were linked to abortion  (4). While deaths from safe abortion are negligible, <1/100 000, in regions where unsafe abortions are common, the death rates are high, at > 200/100 000 abortions  (4) . Estimates from 2012 indicate that in developing countries alone, 7 million women per year were treated in hospital facilities for complications of unsafe abortion  (5) . Physical health risks associated with unsafe abortion include: Restrictive abortion regulation can cause distress and stigma, and risk constituting a violation of human rights of women and girls, including the right to privacy and the right to non-discrimination and equality, while also imposing financial burdens on women and girls. Regulations that force women to travel to attain legal care, or require mandatory counselling or waiting periods, lead to loss of income and other financial costs, and can make abortion inaccessible to women with low resources  (6,7) . Estimates from 2006 show that complications of unsafe abortions cost health systems in developing countries US$ 553 million per year for post-abortion treatments  (8) . In addition, households experienced US$ 922 million in loss of income due to long-term disability related to unsafe abortion  (8) . Countries and health systems could make substantial monetary savings by providing greater access to modern contraception and quality induced abortion  (7,9) . A scoping review from 2021 also indicates that legalization of abortion affects women’s education, participation in the labour market and positively contributes to GDP growth  (9) . The legal status of abortion can further affect children’s educational outcomes, and their earnings in the labour market later in life. By reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and thus increasing the likelihood that children are born wanted, legalization of abortion can be linked to greater parental investments in children, including in girls’ schooling  (9) .\r\n Evidence shows that restricting access to abortions does not reduce the number of abortions  (1) ; however, it does affect whether the abortions that women and girls attain are safe and dignified. The proportion of unsafe abortions are significantly higher in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws than in countries with less restrictive laws  (3) . Barriers to accessing safe and respectful abortion include high costs, stigma for those seeking abortions and health care workers, and the refusal of health workers to provide an abortion based on personal conscience or religious belief. Access is further impeded by restrictive laws and requirements that are not medically justified, including criminalization of abortion, mandatory waiting periods, provision of biased information or counselling, third-party authorization and restrictions regarding the type of health care providers or facilities that can provide abortion services. Multiple actions are needed at the legal, health system and community levels so that everyone who needs abortion care has access to it.
